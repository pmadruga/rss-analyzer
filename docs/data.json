To decide which robot is better, you ask your friends to watch them and say who did better. But your friends sometimes lie or get distracted!\n            - **Type I error**: A friend says Robot A is better when they’re actually the same (you waste time fixing Robot A).\n            - **Type II error**: A friend says they’re the same when Robot A is *actually* better (you miss out on a faster robot!).\n            This paper is like a *lie detector* for your friends’ answers. It helps you figure out:\n            1. How often they’re *wrongly excited* (Type I).\n            2. How often they’re *wrongly bored* (Type II).\n            Then, it gives you a *score* (balanced accuracy) to pick the most reliable friends!\n            \"\n        },\n\n        \"summary_for_authors\": \"\n        Your paper fills a critical gap in IR evaluation by:\n        1. **Highlighting the asymmetry** in how we treat Type I vs. Type II errors, which has skewed research priorities.\n        2. **Proposing balanced metrics** as a pragmatic solution to summarize discriminative power, making it easier to compare qrel methods.\n        3. **Providing actionable insights** for practitioners (e.g., when to invest in higher-quality qrels).\n\n        **Suggestions for future work**:\n        - Test the framework on **real-world qrels** (e.g., TREC datasets with known noise levels).\n        - Explore **adaptive thresholds** for Type I/II errors based on application needs (e.g., medical search vs. e-commerce).\n        - Extend to **online evaluation** (e.g., interleave testing in production systems).\n        \"\n    }\n}\n```",

This keeps the context intact (e.g., a medical procedure’s steps stay grouped) and avoids breaking up coherent ideas.\n                - **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a *graph* of connected entities (e.g., ‘Drug X’ → *treats* → ‘Disease Y’). This helps the AI understand relationships between concepts, not just isolated facts.\n\n                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves irrelevant or fragmented information.

It’s also great at spotting tiny things (like a boat) *and* huge things (like a melting glacier) in the same picture.\n\n        Instead of needing humans to label every pixel (which takes forever), Galileo *teaches itself* by playing a game: it covers up parts of the pictures and tries to guess what’s missing. This makes it really good at understanding how different types of data fit together.\n\n        Why is this cool? Because now we can use *one robot* to:\n        - Find floods faster.\n        - Track crops to help farmers.\n        - Watch glaciers to study climate change.\n        Before, we’d need a *different robot* for each job—but Galileo can do it all!\n        \"\n    }\n}\n```",

The paper shows that by training a model to create 'names' that work for both tasks, you get the best of both worlds.\n\n        **Real-World Impact**:\n        This could lead to smarter, simpler AI systems. Instead of having separate teams for search and recommendations, companies could use one model that does both—saving costs and improving results. For users, it might mean better search results *and* recommendations that actually understand what you’re looking for.\n        \"\n    }\n}\n```",
