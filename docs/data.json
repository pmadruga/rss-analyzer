This makes them poor at *bidirectional* tasks like semantic search or retrieval, where understanding context from *both* directions (e.g., a word’s meaning depends on what comes before *and* after it) is critical.\n\n                **Existing Solutions**:\n                - **Bidirectional Hacks**: Remove the causal mask to enable bidirectional attention, but this *breaks* the LLM’s pretrained knowledge (like forcing a one-way street to suddenly handle two-way traffic—chaos ensues).\n                - **Extra Text Tricks**: Add prompts like 'Summarize this text:' to give the LLM more context, but this *increases computational cost* (longer sequences = slower/more expensive).\n\n                **Causal2Vec’s Innovation**:\n                - **Step 1**: Use a tiny BERT-style model to *pre-process* the input text into a single **Contextual Token** (like a compressed summary of the entire text’s meaning).\n                - **Step 2**: Prepend this token to the LLM’s input. Now, even with causal attention, the LLM ‘sees’ the *global context* via this token *before* processing the rest of the text.\n                - **Step 3**: For the final embedding, combine the hidden states of the **Contextual Token** (global meaning) and the **EOS Token** (last-token bias mitigation).
