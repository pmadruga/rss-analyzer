This token gets placed at the *beginning* of the text, so even though the LLM still processes words one-by-one (left-to-right), every word can 'see' this contextual overview.

This makes them poor at creating *bidirectional* embeddings (where context from both past *and* future tokens matters), which are critical for tasks like semantic search or clustering. Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask (breaking pretrained behavior), or\n                - Add extra input text (increasing compute costs).\n\n                **Solution**: *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny BERT-style module to pre-process the input into a single **Contextual token**, which is prepended to the LLM’s input. This token acts like a ‘cheat sheet’ of bidirectional context, letting the LLM generate better embeddings *without* changing its core architecture or adding much overhead.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re reading a mystery novel *one page at a time* (like a decoder-only LLM). To understand the plot, you’d need to flip back and forth (bidirectional attention). But if someone gave you a *one-sentence summary* of the entire chapter before you start (the Contextual token), you could follow along much better—even reading forward only.

This is great for generation but bad for embeddings, where ‘cat’ in ‘a *cat* chased the dog’ needs to know about ‘dog’ too.\n                - **Causal2Vec’s trick**: The BERT-style encoder sees the *full input* (bidirectional) and distills it into one token. When this token is prepended, the LLM’s causal attention can ‘see’ it for *every* token in the sequence, effectively giving all tokens *some* bidirectional context—without violating causality.\n\n                ### Efficiency Gains\n                - **Sequence length reduction**: The BERT encoder processes the full text once, but the LLM only sees the Contextual token + original text (or a truncated version). For a 512-token input, the LLM might only process ~75 tokens (85% shorter).\n                - **Inference speedup**: Fewer tokens = fewer attention computations.

Analysis: In the context of traditional RAG models, the use of knowledge graphs and semantic chunking allows for a more detailed understanding of the topics and subjects involved, the use of buffer sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance, as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI applications in domain-specific fields.",
