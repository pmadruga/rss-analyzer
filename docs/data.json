This keeps related information intact, reducing noise in retrieval.\n                - **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**: It organizes retrieved information into a graph showing *how entities relate* (e.g., 'Einstein' → 'developed' → 'Theory of Relativity'). This helps the AI understand context better than just pulling raw text snippets.\n\n                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves irrelevant or disjointed chunks, leading to 'hallucinations' or wrong answers. SemRAG fixes this by ensuring the retrieved data is *semantically coherent* and *contextually linked*, improving accuracy without expensive fine-tuning of the LLM itself.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re researching 'climate change causes' in a library:\n                - **Traditional RAG**: Grabs random pages from books (some about weather, others about cars) and asks you to piece them together.

Think of it like setting up a workspace for a human assistant:\n                - **What’s on their desk?** (Tools, notes, files)\n                - **How is it organized?** (Folders, sticky notes, priority lists)\n                - **What do they remember from past tasks?** (Lessons learned, mistakes to avoid)\n                The Manus team discovered that how you *shape this context* often matters more than the raw power of the AI model itself.

They’ll waste time searching, repeat mistakes, and miss critical details.\n                - **Good context**: You give them a *structured checklist* (todo.md), *mask irrelevant tools* (hide the stapler when they’re answering emails), *keep past mistakes visible* (so they learn), and *use the filing cabinet* (file system) for long-term memory.\n                Manus applies these same principles to AI agents, but with technical precision.\"\n        },\n\n        \"key_principles_broken_down\": [\n            {\n                \"principle\": \"Design Around the KV-Cache\",\n                \"why_it_matters\": \"\n                    The **KV-cache** (Key-Value cache) is like the AI’s short-term memory buffer.

This is slow and expensive.\n                    **Problem**: If your context changes unpredictably (e.g., adding a timestamp), the cache becomes useless, increasing costs 10x.\n                    **Solution**:\n                    - Keep the *prefix* (start of the context) stable (e.g., avoid timestamps).\n                    - Append new info *without editing old parts* (like writing in a notebook without erasing).\n                    - Explicitly mark where the cache can ‘break’ (e.g., after the system prompt).\",\n                \"real_world_impact\": \"\n                    For Manus, this reduced latency from ~seconds to ~milliseconds per action and cut API costs by 90% for repeated tasks (e.g., reviewing multiple resumes).\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"principle\": \"Mask, Don’t Remove\",\n                \"why_it_matters\": \"\n                    As agents gain more tools (e.g., browser, calculator, email), the ‘action space’ becomes cluttered.

It tries to split a question into parts (e.g., 'What’s the capital of France?' and 'What’s the capital of Germany?').\n        2. It gets rewarded for correct splits *and* for doing them efficiently.\n        3. Over time, it gets better at spotting opportunities to speed things up.\n\n        **Limitations?**\n        - It works best for questions with clear, separate parts. Open-ended questions (e.g., 'Tell me about history') are harder.\n        - Real-world systems (like Google) have speed limits, so parallelism might not always help.\n\n        **Bottom Line**: This is a step toward AI that’s not just smarter, but *faster* and more cost-effective—like upgrading from a single cashier to multiple checkout lines in a store.\n        \"\n    }\n}\n```",

Over time, it gets better at helping you *without you having to reprogram it*.
