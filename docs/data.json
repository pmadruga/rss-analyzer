Traditional IR evaluation relies on human-labeled data (e.g., 'this document is relevant to this query'), but labeling is expensive. Researchers often use *cheaper* or *alternative* qrel methods (e.g., crowdsourcing, pooling, or automated labeling), but these can introduce errors when deciding if one search system is truly better than another.\n\n                The key insight: **Statistical hypothesis testing in IR evaluation has two types of errors**:\n                - **Type I errors (false positives)**: Saying System A is better than System B when it’s not (e.g., due to noisy qrels).\n                - **Type II errors (false negatives)**: Failing to detect a real improvement in System A over System B (e.g., because the qrels lack sensitivity).\n\n                Prior work focused only on Type I errors. This paper argues that **Type II errors are equally harmful**—they can mislead research by hiding true progress.

For example, crowdsourcing might be cheap but miss true improvements, while expert labels are reliable but expensive. The new metric helps balance these tradeoffs.\n\n        **Why it matters**: Without this, we might waste time on fake improvements or ignore real breakthroughs in search technology. It’s like having a fair referee for a race—ensuring we only celebrate actual winners and don’t overlook hidden champions.\n        \"\n    }\n}\n```",

This makes them poor at *bidirectional* tasks like semantic search or text embeddings, where understanding context from *both* directions matters. Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask entirely (losing pretrained unidirectional strengths), or\n                - Add extra input text (increasing compute costs).\n\n                **Solution (Causal2Vec)**: Instead of hacking the LLM itself, we *pre-process* the input text with a tiny BERT-style model to distill it into a single **Contextual token**. This token is prepended to the LLM’s input, giving *every* token in the LLM access to *bidirectional context* without breaking its causal architecture. Then, we combine the hidden states of this Contextual token + the EOS token to create the final embedding, reducing recency bias (where the LLM overweights the last few tokens).\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine reading a book with a flashlight that only lights up the current page and past pages (causal LLM).

This helps the AI 'see' relationships, not just keywords.\n                - **Retrieving better answers**: When you ask a question, SemRAG fetches *relevant chunks* from the graph, not just keyword matches, so answers are more precise and context-aware.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re studying for an exam:\n                - **Traditional RAG**: You highlight random sentences in your textbook and hope they’re useful later.\n                - **SemRAG**:\n                  1.

These satellites collect *many types of data*:\n            - **Optical images** (like photos, but with extra color bands like infrared),\n            - **Radar data** (which works day/night, even through clouds),\n            - **Elevation maps** (3D terrain),\n            - **Weather data** (temperature, precipitation),\n            - **Pseudo-labels** (noisy or approximate labels, e.g., from weak supervision).\n            Each of these data types is useful for tasks like tracking crops, detecting floods, or monitoring deforestation. But they’re all *different*—like trying to read a book, a map, and a weather report at the same time.\n\n            **The Problem:**\n            - **Scale variability**: A boat might be just 1–2 pixels in an image, while a glacier spans thousands of pixels. A flood might change in hours; a forest grows over decades.\n            - **Modalities don’t mix easily**: Optical and radar data are like apples and oranges—how do you combine them meaningfully?\n            - **Specialized models**: Today, we train separate AI models for each task (e.g., one for crop mapping, another for flood detection). This is inefficient and doesn’t leverage shared patterns across tasks.\n\n            **The Solution (Galileo):**\n            The authors built a *single* AI model (a transformer) that:\n            1. **Handles all modalities at once**—it fuses optical, radar, elevation, etc., into one unified representation.\n            2. **Learns at multiple scales**—it captures both tiny details (e.g., a boat) and huge patterns (e.g., a glacier) *simultaneously*.\n            3. **Uses self-supervised learning**: Instead of requiring labeled data (which is scarce for remote sensing), it learns by *masking* parts of the input and predicting them (like filling in missing puzzle pieces). It has two key tricks:\n               - **Global contrastive loss**: Compares deep features of masked vs. unmasked patches to learn high-level patterns.\n               - **Local contrastive loss**: Compares raw input projections to preserve low-level details (e.g., textures).\n            4. **Generalist model**: One model for *many tasks*—crop mapping, flood detection, land cover classification, etc.—outperforming specialized models trained for each task individually.\n\n            **Why it matters:**\n            - **Efficiency**: Train one model instead of dozens.\n            - **Performance**: Beats state-of-the-art (SoTA) specialist models on 11 benchmarks.\n            - **Scalability**: Can incorporate *new modalities* (e.g., adding air quality data later) without retraining from scratch.\n            \",\n            \"analogy\": \"\n            Think of Galileo like a **universal translator for Earth observation**:\n            - It ‘speaks’ all dialects of satellite data (optical, radar, etc.) and translates them into a common language.\n            - It’s like a **microscope + telescope in one**: zooms in on a fishing boat *and* zooms out to track a hurricane.\n            - It learns by playing a **game of ‘guess the missing piece’** with satellite images, getting smarter without needing human labels.\n            \"\n        },\n\n        \"2_Key_Innovations_Broken_Down\": {\n            \"multimodal_fusion\": {\n                \"what\": \"Combines *heterogeneous* remote sensing data (optical, SAR, elevation, etc.) into a single representation.\",\n                \"how\": \"\n                -
