This gives the LLM ‘bidirectional-like’ context *without* changing its architecture or adding much overhead.

This turns disconnected 'islands' into a connected 'network' where the system can navigate between concepts (e.g., linking 'machine learning' to 'neural networks' to 'backpropagation' with clear paths).\n                - **Step 2 (Hierarchical Retrieval)**: Instead of searching the entire graph at once, it:\n                  a) Starts with the most relevant *fine-grained* entities (e.g., specific terms like 'transformer attention').\n                  b) Uses the graph’s structure to 'traverse upward' to broader concepts (e.g., 'attention mechanisms' → 'deep learning') *only as needed*, gathering just enough context to answer the query.\n                - **Result**: Faster retrieval (46% less redundancy), more accurate answers, and better handling of complex questions that span multiple topics.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a library where books are organized by topic (e.g., 'Biology'), but the shelves have no labels connecting 'Biology' to 'Chemistry' or 'Physics'.

The key innovation is replacing traditional numeric IDs (e.g., `item_12345`) with **Semantic IDs**—machine-readable codes that *encode meaningful information* about the item (e.g., its category, features, or relationships to other items).\n\n                The problem: If you train separate embeddings (vector representations) for search and recommendation, they won’t work well together in a unified model. The solution: **Create a shared Semantic ID space** that balances both tasks by fine-tuning a *bi-encoder* (a model that maps items and queries to the same embedding space) on *both* search and recommendation data.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of Semantic IDs like **DNA barcodes for products**:\n                - Traditional IDs are like random serial numbers (e.g., `SKU-987654321`).
