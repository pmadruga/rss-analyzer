The core insight is that while the **base Transformer architecture (2017) remains unchanged**, modern LLMs tweak 5 key components to optimize for speed, memory, and scalability:\n\n                1. **Attention Mechanisms**:\n                   - *Traditional*: Multi-Head Attention (MHA) → *Efficient*: **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)** (shared keys/values across heads) or **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)** (compresses keys/values to lower dimensions).\n                   - *Local Context*: **Sliding Window Attention** (Gemma 3) restricts attention to nearby tokens, cutting memory use by ~40% with minimal performance loss.\n                   - *No Positional Info*: **NoPE** (SmolLM3) removes explicit positional embeddings (e.g., RoPE), relying only on the causal mask for token ordering.\n\n                2. **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**:\n                   - Replaces dense feed-forward layers with **sparse experts** (e.g., DeepSeek-V3 has 256 experts but only activates 9 per token).\n                   - *Design Choices*:\n                     - **Few Large Experts** (e.g., Llama 4: 2 active experts of size 8,192) vs. **Many Small Experts** (e.g., Qwen3: 8 active experts of size 2,048).\n                     - **Shared Experts** (e.g., DeepSeek-V3, Grok 2.5) handle common patterns, while specialized experts focus on niche tasks.\n                   - *Trade-off*: MoE reduces inference cost but complicates training/stability.\n\n                3. **Normalization**:\n                   - *Placement*: **Pre-Norm** (before attention/FF layers; e.g., Llama 3) vs. **Post-Norm** (after; e.g., OLMo 2) vs. **Hybrid** (Gemma 3 uses both).\n                   - *QK-Norm*: Adds RMSNorm to **queries/keys** before RoPE (OLMo 2, Gemma 3) to stabilize training.\n\n                4. **Width vs. Depth**:\n                   - *Wider* models (e.g., gpt-oss: 2,880-dimensional embeddings) parallelize better but use more memory.\n                   - *Deeper* models (e.g., Qwen3: 48 layers) capture hierarchical features but risk training instability.\n\n                5. **Memory Optimizations**:\n                   - **KV Cache Compression**: MLA (DeepSeek) or sliding windows (Gemma) reduce memory footprint.\n                   - **Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE)** (Gemma 3n): Streams modality-specific embeddings from CPU/SSD on demand.\n                   - **Matryoshka Transformers** (Gemma 3n): Single model can be 'sliced' into smaller sub-models for edge devices.\n\n                **Key Trend**: *Efficiency-first design*. Most innovations (MoE, MLA, sliding windows) aim to **reduce inference cost** (memory/compute) while maintaining or improving performance. The 'best' architecture depends on the use case:\n                - **Local/Edge**: SmolLM3 (3B, NoPE) or Gemma 3n (PLE).\n                - **Scalable Serving**: MoE models (Qwen3 235B, Llama 4).\n                - **Reasoning**: DeepSeek-V3/R1 (MLA + MoE) or Kimi 2 (1T parameters).\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of LLMs like a **modular factory**:\n                - **Attention** = Conveyor belts (GQA/MLA are 'shared belts' for efficiency).\n                - **MoE** = Specialized workstations (only a few active at a time).\n                - **Normalization** = Quality control checks (Pre/Post-Norm = inspecting parts before/after assembly).\n                - **Sliding Windows** = Workers only talking to neighbors (local attention) vs. shouting across the factory (global attention).\n                - **NoPE** = Removing 'position labels' on parts but still assembling them in order.\n                \"\n            },\n\n            \"2_identify_gaps\": {\n                \"unanswered_questions\": [\n                    {\n                        \"question\": \"Why did Qwen3 *remove* shared experts (unlike DeepSeek-V3/Grok 2.5)?\",\n                        \"hypotheses\": [\n                            \"Shared experts may not help at scale (Qwen3 has 8 experts vs. Qwen2.5’s 2).\",\n                            \"Inference optimization challenges (as hinted by Qwen3 devs).\",\n                            \"Empirical evidence showed negligible gains for their setup.\"\n                        ],\n                        \"evidence_needed\": \"Ablation studies comparing shared vs. no shared experts in Qwen3.\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"question\": \"How does **NoPE** scale to >100B parameters?\",\n                        \"hypotheses\": [\n                            \"SmolLM3 only uses NoPE in 1/4 layers—suggests instability at scale.\",\n                            \"May require hybrid approaches (e.g., NoPE + sparse positional signals).\"\n                        ],\n                        \"evidence_needed\": \"Tests on NoPE with 70B+ models (e.g., Llama 4).\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"question\": \"Is **sliding window attention** (Gemma 3) better than **MLA** (DeepSeek) for long contexts?\",\n                        \"hypotheses\": [\n                            \"MLA compresses *all* KV pairs, while sliding windows drop distant tokens entirely.\",\n                            \"Sliding windows may hurt tasks needing global context (e.g., summarization).\"\n                        ],\n                        \"evidence_needed\": \"Head-to-head benchmarks on long-document tasks (e.g., 128K tokens).\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"question\": \"Why does **gpt-oss** use **attention bias units** (abandoned post-GPT-2)?\",\n                        \"hypotheses\": [\n                            \"Legacy code or stability hack for their training setup.\",\n                            \"Empirical evidence in their scale (120B) showed marginal gains.\"\n                        ],\n                        \"evidence_needed\": \"OpenAI’s training logs or ablation studies.\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"missing_data\": [\n                    \"Direct comparisons of **MLA vs. GQA** on identical models (only DeepSeek’s V2 paper has partial data).\",\n                    \"Impact of **QK-Norm** isolated from other changes (e.g., OLMo 2’s Post-Norm).\",\n                    \"Energy efficiency metrics (e.g., FLOPs/watt) for architectures like Gemma 3n’s PLE.\"\n                ]\n            },\n\n            \"3_reconstruct_from_first_principles\": {\n                \"attention_mechanisms\": {\n                    \"multi_head_attention (MHA)\": {\n                        \"formula\": \"Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√d)V\",\n                        \"problems\": [\n                            \"Memory: Stores all K,V pairs (O(n²) for sequence length n).\",\n                            \"Compute: Redundant K,V projections across heads.\"\n                        ]\n                    },\n                    \"grouped_query_attention (GQA)\": {\n                        \"modification\": \"Group heads to share K,V projections (e.g., 4 heads → 2 K,V groups).\",\n                        \"math\": \"For G groups, H heads: K,V computed G times (not H).\",\n                        \"tradeoff\": \"Saves memory but may reduce expressivity if groups are too large.\"\n                    },\n                    \"multi_head_latent_attention (MLA)\": {\n                        \"modification\": \"Compress K,V to lower dimension *d’* via learned projections W↓, then expand back via W↑ at inference.\",\n                        \"math\": \"K’ = W↓K (d’ << d);
