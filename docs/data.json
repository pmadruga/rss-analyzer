The key challenge is that human-labeled relevance data (e.g., 'this document is relevant to this query') is **expensive to collect**, so researchers often use **smaller or approximated qrels** (e.g., crowdsourced labels, pooled judgments, or synthetic data).

The surprising finding is that **LM re-rankers often fail when queries and documents share few overlapping words**, even if they are semantically related.

But the paper shows that if the query and book share *no overlapping words* (e.g., query: *'effects of global warming on Arctic fauna'* vs. book: *'melting ice and marine mammal survival'*), the LM re-ranker might fail, while BM25 (which relies on shared words) could still retrieve relevant results if some keywords align.\n                \",\n                \"why_it_matters\": \"\n                This challenges the assumption that LM re-rankers are *always* superior for semantic search.

Now you can guess 'robbed' or 'flooded' correctly because the sticky note hinted at the topic (finance vs. geography).\n                - Finally, you combine your last thought (EOS token) with the sticky note’s summary to form your final answer.\n                \"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components_deep_dive\": {\n                \"contextual_token\": {\n                    \"what\": \"A single vector (like a '[CLS]' token in BERT) that encodes *bidirectional* context of the entire input, generated by a small auxiliary model (e.g., 2-layer BERT).\",\n                    \"why\": \"\n                    - **Efficiency**: Reduces the LLM’s input sequence length by up to 85% (e.g., a 512-token text → 1 Contextual token + original tokens).\n                    - **Bidirectionality**: The LLM’s causal attention can’t see future tokens, but the Contextual token *already* contains their influence.\n                    - **Lightweight**: The auxiliary model adds minimal overhead (~2% of total parameters).\n                    \",\n                    \"how\": \"\n                    1.

However, these IDs lack semantic meaning, making it hard for a model to generalize across tasks.
