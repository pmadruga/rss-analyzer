The key challenge is that human-labeled relevance data (e.g., 'this document is relevant to query X') is **expensive to collect**, so researchers often use **cheaper, approximate methods** (e.g., crowdsourcing, pooling, or automated labeling).

**Scalability**: RL frameworks are key to deploying models in dynamic, real-world environments (e.g., agents, chatbots).\n            The report’s depth suggests Moonshot AI is pushing boundaries in *how* LLMs are built, not just their size.\"\n        },\n\n        \"step_2_analogies\": {\n            \"MuonClip\": \"Imagine training a chef (the LLM) by not just giving them recipes (traditional supervised learning), but also:\n            -

If you ask it about a rare disease, a standard AI might give vague or incorrect answers because it lacks deep medical knowledge. SemRAG solves this by:\n                - **Chunking documents intelligently**: Instead of splitting text randomly (e.g., by paragraphs), it groups sentences that *mean the same thing* (using cosine similarity of embeddings). This keeps related ideas together.\n                - **Building a knowledge graph**: It maps how concepts relate (e.g., 'Disease X' → 'caused by' → 'Gene Y' → 'treated by' → 'Drug Z'). This helps the AI 'connect the dots' like a human expert.\n                - **Retrieving only relevant info**: When you ask a question, SemRAG fetches the most *semantically linked* chunks and graph connections, not just keyword matches.\n                - **Avoiding fine-tuning**: Unlike other methods that require expensive retraining, SemRAG works by *organizing existing knowledge better*—like a librarian who rearranges books by topic instead of alphabetically.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of SemRAG as a **highly organized research assistant**:\n                - **Traditional RAG** is like dumping all your notes into a pile and hoping to find the right page.
