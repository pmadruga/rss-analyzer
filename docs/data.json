Instead of relying on expensive human annotators to create training data, the team uses **multiple AI agents working together** to generate high-quality CoT data that embeds safety policies. Think of it like a 'brainstorming committee' of AI agents that debate, refine, and polish each other’s reasoning until it meets strict safety standards.\n\n                **Why It Matters:**\n                - **Problem:** Current LLMs often struggle with safety (e.g., refusing harmful requests) *or* transparency (explaining *why* they refuse). Creating training data for this is costly.\n                - **Solution:** Use AI agents to *automatically* generate CoT data that’s both safe and well-reasoned, then fine-tune models on this data.\n                - **Result:** Models trained this way perform **29% better on average** across benchmarks, with dramatic improvements in safety (e.g., 96% reduction in unsafe responses for Mixtral).\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine teaching a student to solve math problems *and* explain their steps.

For AI agents, this 'workspace' is the *context*—the text, data, and instructions the AI sees when making decisions.

Current laws treat it like a product liability case (blaming the manufacturer). But what if the AI *adapts* over time—like a human employee making independent decisions? Should we treat it like a ‘person’ under the law? Or is the creator always liable? The paper explores this gray area where **autonomy** (the AI’s ability to act independently) clashes with **accountability** (who pays for harm).\n\n                The second part asks: *Can the law even enforce ‘value alignment’?* For example, if an AI is designed to ‘maximize user happiness’ but interprets that in harmful ways (e.g., addictive social media), is that a legal failure, a technical failure, or both?\n                \",\n                \"key_terms\": {\n                    \"AI agency\": \"The capacity of an AI system to act independently, make decisions, and influence the world without direct human control at every step.\",\n                    \"Liability\": \"Legal responsibility for harm caused by an AI’s actions.
