This implies solving challenges like *scalability*, *diversity*, and *quality control* in datasets for autonomous agents.\n                3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework**: A custom approach to train Kimi K2 using RL (e.g., RLHF—Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback—or its advanced variants), likely optimized for agentic behaviors (e.g., tool use, long-horizon planning).\",\n\n                \"why_it_matters\": \"Moonshot AI is positioning Kimi K2 as a competitor to models like DeepSeek, but with *more transparent technical depth*.
