      "analysis": "**Key Findings:** Our main discoveries were:\n\n1. **LM Re-rankers Struggle**: On the DRUID dataset, the LM re-rankers didn't do much better than the simple BM25 matcher. This was surprising because we thought they would be much better at understanding complex questions.\n\n2. **Lexical Dissimilarities**: We found that LM re-rankers make mistakes when the answers don't have the same words as the questions, even if the meaning is similar. It's like they get confused when the language isn't straightforward.\n\n3. **Improvement Methods**: The methods we tried to make the LM re-rankers better were mostly helpful for the NQ dataset. This shows that improvements depend on the type of questions and answers.\n\nThese findings are significant because they show that LM re-rankers aren't always worth their cost and that we need better ways to test and improve them.\n\n**Technical Approach:** Think of our technical approach like building a complex machine to sort answers:\n\n1. **BM25 Baseline**: This is like a simple sieve that catches answers with exact word matches to the question. It's fast and cheap but not very smart.\n\n2. **LM Re-rankers**: These are like advanced robots that can understand language. They use neural networks to process the meaning of questions and answers. We used six different types, each with its own way of understanding language.\n\n3. **Separation Metric**: Imagine a ruler that measures how far apart the answers chosen by the simple sieve and the advanced robots are. This helps us see if the robots are just copying the sieve's work.\n\n4. **Improvement Methods**: We tried tweaking the robots by adjusting their settings and training them differently to see if they could do better.\n\nEach component works together to help us understand how well the LM re-rankers perform and where they fall short.\n\n**Methodology:** Imagine you're trying to find the best answers to questions from a large pile of documents. You have two helpers: one is a simple matcher (BM25) who looks for exact word matches, and the other is a sophisticated language model (LM) re-ranker who understands the meaning of words and sentences. The LM re-ranker is supposed to be better because it understands context and semantics, but it's also more expensive to use.\n\nOur goal was to see if the LM re-ranker is always better than the simple matcher. Here's how we approached it:\n\n1. **Choose Datasets**: We picked three different sets of questions and answers (NQ, LitQA2, and DRUID) to test our helpers. These datasets are like different libraries with various types of books and questions.\n\n2. **Evaluate Helpers**: We let both helpers (BM25 and six different LM re-rankers) find the best answers for each question in the datasets.\n\n3. **Compare Performance**: We checked how well each helper did by seeing if they picked the right answers. We expected the LM re-rankers to do better, especially on complex questions.\n\n4. **Identify Errors**: We created a new way to measure how much the LM re-rankers rely on simple word matches instead of understanding the meaning. This is like checking if the sophisticated helper is just mimicking the simple one.\n\n5. **Improve LM Re-rankers**: We tried different methods to make the LM re-rankers better and saw if these methods helped, especially on the NQ dataset.\n\nEach step was necessary to understand if the LM re-rankers are worth their cost and to identify their weaknesses.",

      "analysis": "**Key Findings:** Our main discoveries were both surprising and significant:\n\n1. **Prevalence of Hallucinations**: Even the best-performing LLMs produced a lot of hallucinations. In some cases, up to 86% of the generated facts were incorrect, depending on the domain. This is like finding out that even the best storytellers make up a lot of their stories.\n\n2. **Error Types**: We found that hallucinations could be categorized into three types: Type A (misremembering facts), Type B (learning wrong facts), and Type C (making up facts). This helps us understand the root causes of these hallucinations, similar to diagnosing why a storyteller makes mistakes.\n\n3. **Domain Variability**: The frequency and type of hallucinations varied across different domains. For example, hallucinations in scientific attribution might be different from those in programming. This is like noticing that your friend tells more accurate stories about certain topics but makes more mistakes in others.\n\nThese findings are significant because they highlight the need for better methods to identify and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, ultimately making them more trustworthy.\n\n**Technical Approach:** To understand our technical approach, let’s break it down into simpler parts:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: We started by collecting a diverse set of prompts. Think of this as gathering a wide range of questions to ask the LLM, ensuring we cover different topics and scenarios.\n\n2. **Model Generation**: We then used these prompts to generate responses from various LLMs. This is like feeding questions into different storytelling machines and collecting their outputs.\n\n3. **Decomposition**: We broke down these responses into atomic units. Imagine taking a complex sentence and breaking it into individual facts or statements.\n\n4. **Verification**: For each atomic unit, we used automatic verifiers. These are like mini fact-checkers that compare each statement against a reliable knowledge base. For example, if the LLM says 'The capital of France is Paris,' our verifier checks this against a trusted source to confirm it’s true.\n\n5. **Error Classification**: We classified errors into three types: Type A (recollection errors), Type B (training data errors), and Type C (fabrications). This is like labeling mistakes based on their cause—whether the model misremembered, learned wrong information, or made something up.\n\nOur thought process was to create a systematic and scalable way to identify and understand hallucinations in LLMs. By breaking down the problem into these steps, we ensured that our approach was both comprehensive and efficient.\n\n**Methodology:** Imagine you have a friend who tells amazing stories, but sometimes they mix up facts or make things up. You want to catch these mistakes, but listening to every story and checking every detail is too much work. This is similar to the problem with large language models (LLMs)—they generate great text but sometimes 'hallucinate,' or make stuff up.\n\nTo tackle this, we created HALoGEN, a tool to catch these hallucinations efficiently. Here’s how we did it, step by step:\n\n1. **Collecting Prompts**: We gathered 10,923 prompts from nine different areas like programming, science, and summarization. Think of these prompts as questions or topics we ask the LLM to talk about.\n\n2. **Generating Responses**: We fed these prompts to 14 different LLMs and collected about 150,000 responses. This is like asking your storytelling friend to tell stories on various topics and recording them.\n\n3. **Breaking Down Responses**: We broke down each response into smaller, manageable pieces called 'atomic units.' This is similar to breaking a story into individual sentences or facts.\n\n4. **Verifying Facts**: For each atomic unit, we created automatic verifiers that check if the fact is true by comparing it to a reliable source of knowledge. This is like having a fact-checker who listens to your friend’s stories and verifies each detail against a trusted source.\n\n5. **Classifying Errors**: We categorized the hallucinations into three types: Type A (misremembering facts), Type B (learning wrong facts), and Type C (making up facts). This helps us understand why the LLM made a mistake, similar to figuring out if your friend mixed up details, learned something wrong, or made something up.\n\nEach step was necessary to systematically identify and understand hallucinations in LLMs, making the process efficient and scalable.",

      "analysis": "**Key Findings:** Our main discovery was that by combining prompt engineering and contrastive fine-tuning, we could significantly improve the model's ability to create meaningful text embeddings. This was evident in our results on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where our approach achieved state-of-the-art performance.\n\nWe also found that fine-tuning shifted the model's focus from the prompt tokens to more semantically relevant words. This means the model was better at compressing meaning into the final summary, making it more effective for downstream tasks like clustering and classification.\n\nThese findings are significant because they show that LLMs can be adapted for tasks they weren't originally designed for, opening up new possibilities for their application.\n\n**Technical Approach:** To understand our technical approach, let's break it down into simpler parts:\n\n1. **Aggregation Techniques**: We started with basic methods like averaging the word representations (embeddings) to create a sentence summary. This is like taking the average score of a class to represent the overall performance.\n\n2. **Prompt Engineering**: We designed specific prompts to guide the model. For example, we might tell the model to 'Summarize the following text:' before giving it the input. This helps the model understand what task it needs to perform.\n\n3. **Contrastive Fine-tuning**: We used a technique called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning. Think of it as making small adjustments to the model's knowledge base to improve its performance on our specific task. We created synthetic positive pairs (similar texts) and negative pairs (dissimilar texts) to train the model to recognize differences.\n\nOur thought process was to start with simple aggregation methods and then gradually guide and refine the model's understanding through prompt engineering and fine-tuning.\n\nThe components work together like a team: aggregation techniques provide the initial summary, prompt engineering guides the model's focus, and contrastive fine-tuning refines its understanding.\n\n**Methodology:** Imagine you have a powerful tool that can understand and generate human language, but it's not very good at summarizing information into a single, meaningful representation. This is the problem we faced with Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are great at generating text but struggle to create accurate summaries (embeddings) of entire sentences or documents, which are crucial for tasks like clustering, classification, or retrieval.\n\nTo tackle this, we broke down our approach into three main steps:\n\n1. **Aggregation Techniques**: First, we tried different ways to combine the information from individual words (tokens) into a single summary. Think of it like trying to summarize a book by combining sentences in different ways to capture the main idea.\n\n2. **Prompt Engineering**: Next, we used specific instructions (prompts) to guide the model. This is like giving a student clear guidelines on how to summarize a text, making it easier for them to focus on the important parts.\n\n3. **Contrastive Fine-tuning**: Finally, we fine-tuned the model using a method called contrastive learning. This involves showing the model pairs of similar and dissimilar texts and teaching it to distinguish between them. It's like teaching a student to recognize similarities and differences by showing them examples.\n\nEach step was necessary to improve the model's ability to create meaningful summaries. Aggregation techniques helped combine information, prompt engineering guided the model's focus, and contrastive fine-tuning refined its understanding of similarities and differences.",

      "analysis": "**Key Findings:** After running many RAG systems through ARES, we found:\n\n1. **Accuracy Varied Widely**: Some systems were great at finding exact info, others weren't. It was like having some librarians who always find the right book and others who don't.\n2. **Relevance Was Tricky**: Even if a system was accurate, it sometimes gave irrelevant info. Like a librarian who gives you a book in the wrong language.\n3. **Efficiency Matters**: Faster systems weren't always better. Sometimes, a quick but inaccurate answer is worse than a slow, correct one.\n\nThese findings matter because they show RAG systems have strengths and weaknesses. Knowing these helps us improve them, like training librarians to be better at their jobs.\n\n**Technical Approach:** Think of ARES as a automated judge for RAG systems. Here's how we built it:\n\n1. **Modular Design**: We broke down ARES into smaller parts, each with a specific job:\n   - **Data Loader**: Loads our dataset of questions and answers.\n   - **RAG Interface**: Connects to the RAG system being tested.\n   - **Evaluator**: Measures the RAG system's performance using our metrics.\n   - **Reporter**: Summarizes the results in an easy-to-understand format.\n\n2. **Metrics Calculation**: For each question, ARES sends it to the RAG system, gets an answer, and compares it to the expected answer. It calculates accuracy (was the answer correct?), relevance (was it on topic?), and efficiency (how long did it take?).\n\n3. **Automation**: We used scripts to automate the process. Like a conveyor belt, ARES feeds questions to the RAG system, evaluates answers, and moves to the next question.\n\n4. **Feedback Loop**: We included a way for ARES to learn from each test. If it sees a new type of question, it adds it to the dataset for future tests.\n\nWe chose this approach because it's systematic, fair, and improves over time. It's like having a diligent student test every librarian thoroughly and learn from each test.\n\n**Methodology:** Imagine you're in a library trying to find information for a report. You have two options: search through books yourself (retrieval) or ask a librarian who knows where to find the info (generation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine these methods: they retrieve relevant info and generate answers based on it. Our goal was to evaluate how well these systems work automatically.\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: RAG systems are complex, and evaluating them manually is time-consuming. We needed an automated way to test their performance.\n2. **Define Metrics**: First, we decided what 'good performance' means. Like judging a librarian, we looked at accuracy (right info), relevance (useful info), and efficiency (quick responses).\n3. **Create a Dataset**: We gathered a variety of questions and corresponding answers that a good RAG system should handle.\n4. **Develop Evaluation Framework (ARES)**: We built ARES to automate testing. It takes a RAG system, runs it through our dataset, and measures performance using our metrics.\n5. **Iterative Testing**: We repeatedly tested ARES with different RAG systems, improving it based on feedback until it was reliable.\n\nEach step was crucial. Defining metrics ensured we knew what to measure, the dataset provided a fair test, ARES automated the process, and iterative testing refined our tool.",

      "analysis": "**Key Findings:** Our main discovery is that by using the Causal2Vec approach, we can significantly improve the performance of decoder-only LLMs on embedding tasks. This is important because it means we can make these models better at understanding the meaning of text without changing their original design or adding a lot of extra computational costs.\n\nWe found that Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets. Even more impressive, it reduces the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared to best-performing methods. This means our approach not only makes the model better but also more efficient.\n\n**Technical Approach:** Let's break down the technical implementation into simple components:\n\n1. **Lightweight BERT-style model**: This is a small, efficient model that takes the input text and produces a single Contextual token. It's like a mini-librarian that quickly scans the text and gives you a summary.\n\n2. **Prepending the Contextual token**: We simply add this summary token to the beginning of the input sequence for the LLM. This is like placing a cheat sheet at the start of the text.\n\n3. **Concatenating last hidden states**: The LLM processes the text and produces hidden states for each token. We take the hidden states of the Contextual token and the EOS token, and concatenate them to form the final text embedding. This is like combining the notes from the librarian and the last word in the text.\n\nWe chose this approach because it's lightweight and doesn't require changing the LLM's architecture or introducing significant computational overhead. It's like having a helpful librarian assist our book without changing how the book works.\n\n**Methodology:** Imagine you have a big book of language rules (our decoder-only LLM) that you use to understand and generate text. The book has a special rule: you can only look at the past words to understand the current word (causal attention). This is great for generating text but not so good for understanding the meaning of a whole sentence at once (embedding tasks).\n\nOur goal is to make this book better at embedding tasks without changing its rules too much. Here's how we did it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Pre-encoding with a lightweight BERT-style model**: Think of this as a helpful librarian who quickly scans the text and gives you a summary token (Contextual token) that captures the essence of the text. This token is like a cheat sheet that we place at the start of the text.\n\n2. **Prepending the Contextual token**: By placing this cheat sheet at the beginning, our book (LLM) can now see a summary of the whole text while still following its 'look at the past' rule. This helps it understand the meaning of the text better.\n\n3. **Concatenating last hidden states**: To create the final text embedding, we combine the information from the Contextual token and the end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This is like having a quick meeting with the librarian and the last word in the text to get a final summary.\n\nEach step is crucial because it allows our book to follow its rules while still getting a broader understanding of the text, making it better at embedding tasks.",

      "analysis": "**Key Findings:** Our main discoveries were:\n\n1. **Improved Retrieval Accuracy**: By using semantic chunking and knowledge graphs, we significantly improved the relevance and correctness of the information retrieved. This means the model was better at finding the right answers to questions.\n\n2. **Efficiency Without Fine-Tuning**: We showed that it's possible to enhance the performance of LLMs in domain-specific tasks without extensive fine-tuning. This makes our approach more practical and scalable.\n\n3. **Optimal Buffer Sizes**: We found that optimizing buffer sizes for different datasets can further improve retrieval performance. This is like finding the perfect number of books for the librarian to hold, making the search process more efficient.\n\nThese findings are significant because they address the original problem of making LLMs more effective in specialized fields without requiring a lot of resources. By improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency, we make it easier to use LLMs in real-world applications.\n\n**Technical Approach:** Let's break down the technical implementation into simple parts:\n\n1. **Sentence Embeddings**: Think of sentence embeddings as converting sentences into numerical representations that capture their meaning. We used pre-trained models to generate these embeddings, which helped us compare sentences based on their semantic similarity.\n\n2. **Cosine Similarity**: This is like measuring the angle between two vectors. If the angle is small, the vectors (or sentences, in our case) are similar. We used cosine similarity to group sentences into semantic chunks.\n\n3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: We built knowledge graphs by identifying entities (like people, places, or things) and their relationships in the text. This involved using natural language processing techniques to extract and structure this information.\n\n4. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: RAG is like a librarian who finds relevant books (documents) and then helps you summarize the information. We enhanced RAG by integrating our semantic chunks and knowledge graphs, making the librarian more efficient and accurate.\n\n5. **Buffer Size Optimization**: Think of buffer size as the number of books the librarian can hold at once. We experimented with different buffer sizes to find the optimal number that balances retrieval performance and computational efficiency.\n\nOur thought process was to create a system that is both effective and efficient. By breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and using existing tools and techniques, we were able to achieve this.\n\n**Methodology:** Imagine you're trying to find answers to specific questions using a large book, but the book is so big and complex that it's hard to find the right information quickly. This is similar to the challenge we face with large language models (LLMs) when they need to answer questions in specialized fields. Our goal was to make this process more efficient and accurate without spending too much time or resources.\n\nHere's how we approached it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: LLMs struggle with domain-specific tasks because they lack specialized knowledge and retrieving relevant information is computationally expensive.\n\n2. **Semantic Chunking**: Think of a book with chapters. Each chapter has a specific topic, making it easier to find information. Similarly, we divided documents into smaller, meaningful chunks based on their semantic similarity. We used sentence embeddings and cosine similarity to group sentences that are closely related, preserving the meaning while making the search faster.\n\n3. **Knowledge Graphs**: Imagine a map that shows how different places are connected. A knowledge graph does the same for information, showing relationships between different pieces of data. By structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, we captured these relationships, making it easier to understand the context and retrieve accurate information.\n\n4. **Integration Without Fine-Tuning**: Instead of retraining the entire model, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, we integrated the knowledge graphs and semantic chunks directly into the retrieval process. This way, we enhanced the model's performance without extensive fine-tuning.\n\n5. **Experimentation**: We tested our approach on different datasets to see how well it worked. We also optimized buffer sizes for different data corpora to improve retrieval performance further.\n\nEach step was chosen to address specific challenges: semantic chunking to reduce computational overhead, knowledge graphs to improve contextual understanding, and integration without fine-tuning to make the process efficient and scalable.",

      "analysis": "**Key Findings:** Our main discoveries and results can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **KV-Cache Hit Rate**: Improving the KV-cache hit rate is crucial for reducing latency and cost in production-stage AI agents. By keeping the prompt prefix stable, making the context append-only, and marking cache breakpoints explicitly, we significantly improved the agent's performance.\n\n2. **Context-Aware State Machine**: Using a state machine to manage tool availability and masking token logits during decoding proved to be an effective way to control action selection without disrupting the KV-cache.\n\n3. **File System as Context**: Treating the file system as the ultimate context allowed us to handle large observations and avoid context limits. This approach provided unlimited, persistent, and directly operable memory for the agent.\n\n4. **Attention Manipulation**: Rewriting a todo list helped push the global plan into the model's recent attention span, reducing goal misalignment and keeping the agent focused on long tasks.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Leaving failed actions in the context helped the model adapt and avoid repeating mistakes. This approach emphasized error recovery as a key aspect of agentic behavior.\n\n6. **Avoiding Few-Shot Prompting**: Introducing structured variation in actions and observations prevented the agent from falling into repetitive patterns, improving its adaptability and performance.\n\nThese findings were significant because they addressed fundamental challenges in building an effective AI agent, making the agent more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Technical Approach:** Our technical implementation revolved around several core principles:\n\n1. **KV-Cache Optimization**: To improve the KV-cache hit rate, we kept our prompt prefix stable, made our context append-only, and marked cache breakpoints explicitly when needed. For self-hosted models, we ensured prefix/prompt caching was enabled and used techniques like session IDs to route requests consistently across distributed workers.\n\n2. **Context-Aware State Machine**: Instead of dynamically adding or removing tools, we used a state machine to manage tool availability. This involved masking token logits during decoding to control action selection based on the current context. We used response prefill modes like Auto, Required, and Specified to constrain the action space without modifying tool definitions.\n\n3. **File System as Context**: We designed compression strategies that were always restorable, allowing the model to drop content from the context while preserving essential information. This approach treated the file system as unlimited, persistent, and directly operable memory.\n\n4. **Attention Manipulation**: By having the agent rewrite a todo list, we pushed the global plan into the model's recent attention span, reducing goal misalignment and keeping the agent focused on long tasks.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: We deliberately left failed actions in the context to help the model adapt and avoid repeating mistakes. This approach emphasized error recovery as a key aspect of agentic behavior.\n\n6. **Avoiding Few-Shot Prompting**: To prevent the agent from falling into repetitive patterns, we introduced structured variation in actions and observations. This controlled randomness helped break the pattern and tweak the model's attention.\n\nEach of these technical choices was driven by the need to create a flexible, adaptable, and efficient AI agent that could handle complex tasks in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Methodology:** At the start of the Manus project, we faced a critical decision: should we train an end-to-end agentic model using open-source foundations, or build an agent on top of the in-context learning abilities of frontier models? This decision was pivotal because it would determine how quickly we could iterate and improve our AI agent.\n\nIn the early days of NLP, models like BERT required fine-tuning and evaluation before they could be applied to new tasks. This process was slow, taking weeks per iteration, even for relatively small models. For fast-moving applications, especially those pre-product-market fit (PMF), such slow feedback loops are impractical. I learned this the hard way at my last startup, where we trained models from scratch for tasks like open information extraction and semantic search. When GPT-3 and Flan-T5 emerged, our in-house models became obsolete overnight. However, these new models introduced in-context learning, offering a new path forward.\n\nGiven this experience, we chose to bet on context engineering for Manus. This approach allows us to ship improvements in hours instead of weeks and keeps our product flexible and adaptable to underlying model advancements. However, context engineering turned out to be far from straightforward. It's an experimental science, and we had to rebuild our agent framework multiple times as we discovered better ways to shape context.\n\nOur methodology involved several key steps:\n\n1. **Design Around the KV-Cache**: We identified the KV-cache hit rate as the most critical metric for a production-stage AI agent. This metric directly affects latency and cost. By understanding how a typical agent operates—receiving user input, selecting actions, and executing them in an environment—we realized that the context grows with each step, while the output remains relatively short. This insight led us to focus on improving the KV-cache hit rate to reduce time-to-first-token (TTFT) and inference cost.\n\n2. **Mask, Don't Remove**: As the agent's capabilities grew, so did its action space. To manage this complexity, we avoided dynamically adding or removing tools mid-iteration. Instead, we used a context-aware state machine to mask token logits during decoding, preventing or enforcing the selection of certain actions based on the current context.\n\n3. **Use the File System as Context**: To handle large observations and avoid context limits, we treated the file system as the ultimate context. The model learns to write to and read from files on demand, using the file system as structured, externalized memory.\n\n4. **Manipulate Attention Through Recitation**: To keep the agent focused on long tasks, we introduced a mechanism where the agent constantly rewrites a todo list, pushing the global plan into the model's recent attention span.\n\n5. **Keep the Wrong Stuff In**: We found that leaving failed actions in the context helps the model adapt and avoid repeating mistakes. Error recovery became a crucial indicator of agentic behavior.\n\n6. **Don't Get Few-Shotted**: To prevent the agent from falling into repetitive patterns, we introduced structured variation in actions and observations, breaking the pattern and tweaking the model's attention.\n\nEach of these steps was necessary to address specific challenges we encountered in building an effective AI agent.",
