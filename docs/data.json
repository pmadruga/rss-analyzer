If you ask it about a rare disease, a *normal* AI might:\n                - Pull random snippets from medical textbooks (some irrelevant).\n                - Miss connections between symptoms, drugs, and side effects.\n                - Give a vague or wrong answer because it doesn’t *understand* the relationships.\n\n                **SemRAG fixes this by:**\n                1. **Splitting documents *semantically***:\n                   - Instead of chopping a textbook into arbitrary 500-word chunks (which might cut a sentence in half), it groups sentences that *mean the same thing* together using math (cosine similarity of embeddings).\n                   - *Example*: All sentences about 'diabetes symptoms' stay together, even if they’re scattered across pages.\n\n                2. **Building a *knowledge graph***:\n                   - It maps how concepts relate (e.g., 'Drug X → treats → Disease Y → causes → Symptom Z').\n                   - When you ask, 'What drug treats Disease Y?', it *follows the graph* to find the answer, not just keyword-matching.\n\n                3. **Optimizing the 'buffer size'**:\n                   - Like adjusting how much context the AI 'holds in mind' at once.

This ensures related ideas stay together, like clustering all sentences about 'photosynthesis' in a biology text.\n                - **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a graph showing *relationships* between entities (e.g., 'Einstein' → 'developed' → 'Theory of Relativity'). This helps the AI understand context better than just reading raw text.\n\n                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves irrelevant or disjointed chunks, leading to 'hallucinations' or wrong answers.

Unlike traditional fine-tuning, context engineering leverages the in-context learning capabilities of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, Claude) to dynamically shape how agents interact with their environment. The key insight is that *how you structure and manipulate the context* (not just the model itself) determines the agent's behavior, cost, and reliability.\",\n\n                \"analogy\": \"Think of context engineering like designing a **workshop for a craftsman**:\n                - **Tools (actions)**: The agent’s available functions (e.g., browsing the web, running code).\n                - **Workbench (context)**: The shared space where tools, materials (observations), and instructions (prompts) are arranged.\n                - **Memory (file system)**: External storage for large or persistent data (like a filing cabinet).\n                - **Attention (recitation)**: The craftsman’s habit of repeating key steps aloud to stay focused.\n                If the workshop is cluttered or poorly organized, the craftsman (agent) will waste time, make mistakes, or forget goals.
