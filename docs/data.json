Now, every token in the LLM’s input can 'see' high-level context *without* needing bidirectional attention.\n                3. **Smart Pooling**: Instead of just using the last token’s hidden state (which biases toward the *end* of the text), combine the **Contextual token’s final state** + the **EOS token’s state** for a richer embedding.\n\n                **Result**: The LLM acts like a bidirectional model *without* architectural changes, while being **85% faster** (shorter sequences) and **82% cheaper** at inference.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re reading a book but can only look *backward* (like a decoder-only LLM).

But these IDs carry no meaning—like a library using random numbers instead of Dewey Decimal codes. The paper proposes **Semantic IDs**: meaningful, learned representations (like short descriptive codes) derived from item embeddings (vector representations of items' content/attributes).\n\n                The key problem: If you train separate embeddings for search (e.g., matching queries to documents) and recommendation (e.g., predicting user preferences), they might conflict when combined in a single generative model. The paper explores how to create **unified Semantic IDs** that work well for *both* tasks simultaneously.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a bilingual dictionary where every word has two definitions—one for English speakers and one for French speakers.

Think of it like a video game character that starts weak but gets smarter and more skilled the more you play, except here, the 'character' is an AI system working in the real world (e.g., managing your schedule, diagnosing diseases, or trading stocks).\n\n                The problem today is that most AI agents are **static**: they’re built once and don’t change, even if the world around them does. This survey explores how to make agents **self-evolving**—able to update their own logic, tools, or even goals based on feedback from their environment. It’s a bridge between two big ideas:\n                - **Foundation Models** (like ChatGPT): Powerful but general-purpose AI that doesn’t specialize.\n                - **Lifelong Learning**: AI that keeps improving forever, like a human gaining wisdom over decades.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a **self-driving car**:\n                - *Static agent*: Programmed with fixed rules (e.g., 'stop at red lights'). If traffic patterns change (e.g., new pedestrian zones), it fails unless a human updates its code.\n                - *Self-evolving agent*: Notices it keeps braking too late near schools, so it *automatically* adjusts its speed limits in those areas—or even *invents a new rule* like 'scan for children when near playgrounds.'
