Just as your computer slows down when RAM is full, LLMs struggle when their context windows are overloaded.\nThe Four Pillars of Context Engineering:\nWrite Context: Just as you take notes while solving problems, agents need scratchpads and memories Select Context: Not everything in your notes is relevant - context selection is like having a smart assistant who knows which files to pull Compress Context: Sometimes you need to summarize War and Peace into a paragraph Isolate Context: Complex tasks benefit from splitting context across specialized sub-agents Why This Matters Now: As we build agents that can work for hours or days on complex tasks, context management becomes THE critical bottleneck. It’s not about having the smartest model - it’s about using its intelligence efficiently.\nThe Key Insight: Context engineering isn’t just an optimization - it’s fundamental to agent capability. We’re moving from “prompt engineering” (what to say) to “context engineering” (what to remember and when).\nThis analysis was generated using the Feynman technique, where the AI takes on the role of the paper’s author and explains the research using simple language and analogies to make complex concepts accessible.

With just 1,000 carefully chosen examples, we can teach them to be nearly twice as efficient while maintaining the same accuracy!\nThe Two-Stage Magic: My approach works in two clever stages. Stage 1 teaches the model to recognize when it actually needs more information. Stage 2 trains it to reason through documents efficiently, connecting pieces of information without redundant searches.\nWhy This Matters: Current RAG systems are like students who run to the library every time they need to answer any part of a question. My system reduces retrieval calls by nearly 50% while maintaining competitive accuracy.\nThe Surprising Discovery: You don’t need millions of examples to achieve this. With just 1,000 well-chosen training examples, the model learns the PATTERN of when retrieval is useful, not just memorizing specific cases.\nThis analysis was generated using the Feynman technique, where the AI takes on the role of the paper’s author and explains the research using simple language and analogies to make complex concepts accessible.

I’m proposing a comprehensive framework for “LLM Ensemble” - making multiple large language models collaborate like musicians in an orchestra.\nThree Ways to Ensemble:\nEnsemble-Before-Inference: Like having a pre-meeting where experts discuss strategy Ensemble-During-Inference: Models work together in real-time, like a surgical team Ensemble-After-Inference: Combining outputs after generation, like synthesizing multiple expert reports The Challenge of Coordination: The hardest part isn’t getting models to work - it’s getting them to work TOGETHER effectively. How do you resolve disagreements? Prevent redundant work? Ensure models complement rather than interfere?\nWhy This Changes Everything: Single models have inherent biases and blind spots. By combining multiple models, we can compensate for individual weaknesses, achieve more reliable outputs, and handle more complex tasks.\nThis analysis was generated using the Feynman technique, where the AI takes on the role of the paper’s author and explains the research using simple language and analogies to make complex concepts accessible.

Think of it like this: AI systems have guards at the door (safety filters) that check if someone is trying to make them do something harmful. But what if instead of walking up to the guard directly, you dressed up in a professor’s outfit and started using incredibly complex academic language?\nHow It Works: The InfoFlood method transforms simple, potentially harmful requests into elaborate academic prose filled with complex words, fake citations, and technical jargon. It’s like wrapping a simple request in so many layers of academic packaging that the AI gets confused about what’s actually being asked.\nWhy It Works: Large Language Models rely on pattern recognition. When you bury the actual request under mountains of academic-sounding text, the model’s attention gets diluted. The safety filters are looking for obvious red flags, but academic language rarely triggers these filters.\nThe Implications: This reveals a fundamental weakness in how we currently implement AI safety: we’re too focused on surface-level patterns rather than deep understanding of intent.\nThis analysis was generated using the Feynman technique, where the AI takes on the role of the paper’s author and explains the research using simple language and analogies to make complex concepts accessible.

Instead of focusing on making models smarter, we need to make them better at managing their own memories and attention.\nThe Technical Implementation:\nState Management as Memory: Every agent needs a state object - think of it as the agent’s desk Multi-Agent Architecture: For complex tasks, split work across specialized agents like running a newspaper Sandboxing for Safety: Isolate operations that generate massive data in separate environments The Practical Impact: With proper context engineering, we’re seeing agents handle tasks 10x longer without degrading, 50% reduction in token usage, and more reliable performance.\nThe Future Vision: We’re moving toward agents that can work on problems for days or weeks, maintaining context across sessions and managing their own cognitive resources.\nThis analysis was generated using the Feynman technique, where the AI takes on the role of the paper’s author and explains the research using simple language and analogies to make complex concepts accessible.

We’ve been obsessed with avoiding Type I errors (false positives) but completely ignoring Type II errors (false negatives). That’s like a doctor who’s so worried about misdiagnosing healthy people that they miss actual sick patients!\nMy Solution: I propose that we need to measure BOTH types of errors to truly understand how good our evaluation methods are. I introduce balanced accuracy as a single metric that captures both how often you correctly identify differences and how often you correctly identify no difference.\nThe Key Insight: Different evaluation methods have different “discriminative power” - their ability to correctly identify when one system is truly better than another. By only measuring Type I errors, we’ve been flying half-blind.\nWhat This Means: We need to rethink how we evaluate our evaluation methods. We’ve been so conservative about avoiding false positives that we may have been using evaluation approaches that miss real improvements.\nThis analysis was generated using the Feynman technique, where the AI takes on the role of the paper’s author and explains the research using simple language and analogies to make complex concepts accessible.
