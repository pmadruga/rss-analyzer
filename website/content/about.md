# About RSS Article Analysis

This project automatically fetches and analyzes academic papers from RSS feeds using AI APIs (Anthropic Claude, Mistral, or OpenAI). The goal is to make complex research accessible through the Feynman technique.

## How It Works

1. **RSS Feed Parsing**: Automatically fetches articles from configured RSS feeds
2. **Content Scraping**: Extracts full article content from academic publisher websites
3. **AI Analysis**: Uses the Feynman technique to generate educational explanations
4. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive reports in multiple formats

## The Feynman Technique

All analyses use the Feynman technique, where:
- The AI takes on the role of the paper's author
- Complex concepts are explained using simple language and analogies
- Technical details are broken down to fundamental components
- Research is explained step-by-step with clear reasoning

## Supported Sources

- **Academic**: arXiv, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Nature, PubMed
- **Tech Companies**: OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, Google AI Research
- **Tech Blogs**: Medium, Substack, TechCrunch, Wired
- **Social Media**: Bluesky posts with embedded arXiv links

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with SQLite database
- **AI Providers**: Anthropic Claude, Mistral AI, OpenAI
- **Website**: Hugo with Hextra theme
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
