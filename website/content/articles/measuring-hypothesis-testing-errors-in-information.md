The Problem I'm Solving: When we test whether one search system is better than another, we typically make mistakes - but we've only been counting half of them! We've been obsessed with avoiding Type I errors (false positives) but completely ignoring Type II errors (false negatives). That's like a doctor who's so worried about misdiagnosing healthy people that they miss actual sick patients!

My Solution: I propose that we need to measure BOTH types of errors to truly understand how good our evaluation methods are. I introduce balanced accuracy as a single metric that captures both how often you correctly identify differences and how often you correctly identify no difference.

The Key Insight: Different evaluation methods have different "discriminative power" - their ability to correctly identify when one system is truly better than another. By only measuring Type I errors, we've been flying half-blind.

What This Means: We need to rethink how we evaluate our evaluation methods. We've been so conservative about avoiding false positives that we may have been using evaluation approaches that miss real improvements.
