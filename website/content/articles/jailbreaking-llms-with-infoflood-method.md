# Jailbreaking LLMs with InfoFlood Method

The Core Idea: I've discovered a way to trick AI systems by speaking in a way that sounds incredibly academic and sophisticated, but is actually just nonsense designed to confuse the AI's safety systems. Think of it like this: AI systems have guards at the door (safety filters) that check if someone is trying to make them do something harmful. But what if instead of walking up to the guard directly, you dressed up in a professor's outfit and started using incredibly complex academic language?

How It Works: The InfoFlood method transforms simple, potentially harmful requests into elaborate academic prose filled with complex words, fake citations, and technical jargon. It's like wrapping a simple request in so many layers of academic packaging that the AI gets confused about what's actually being asked.

Why It Works: Large Language Models rely on pattern recognition. When you bury the actual request under mountains of academic-sounding text, the model's attention gets diluted. The safety filters are looking for obvious red flags, but academic language rarely triggers these filters.

The Implications: This reveals a fundamental weakness in how we currently implement AI safety: we're too focused on surface-level patterns rather than deep understanding of intent.

This analysis was generated using the Feynman technique, where the AI takes on the role of the paper's author and explains the research using simple language and analogies to make complex concepts accessible.
