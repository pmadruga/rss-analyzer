Instant Adaptation: T2L can adapt LLMs in a single forward pass based on natural language task descriptions. After training on just 9 LoRA adapters, it matches task-specific performance and generalizes to unseen tasks.

Democratization: This approach provides language-based adaptation with minimal compute requirements, making model specialization accessible to a broader audience.
