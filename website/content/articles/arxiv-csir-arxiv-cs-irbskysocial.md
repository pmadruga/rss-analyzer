## User Understanding Agent

This agent uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze user data and create a summary of preferences. It looks at both long-term behaviors and current session activities to build a comprehensive user profile.
2.

## Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent

This agent also uses LLMs to check the semantic alignment between the retrieved items and the user's intent. It ensures that the recommendations make sense in the context of what the user is currently interested in.
3.

## Context Summary Agent

This agent takes the outputs from the NLI agent and creates a summary that highlights the most relevant information. This summary helps in making informed decisions in the next step.
4.

## Item Ranker Agent

This agent generates a ranked list of recommendations. It uses the contextual information provided by the previous agents to determine the best order for presenting items to the user.
5.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

All these agents work together in a pipeline. The User Understanding Agent feeds data to the RAG process, which retrieves candidate items. The NLI Agent then filters these items, and the Context Summary Agent prepares the data for the Item Ranker Agent to create the final recommendations.

The choice of LLMs for these agents is crucial because they can handle complex language tasks and adapt to new data, making the recommendations more accurate and personalized.

**Methodology:** The research methodology for ARAG (Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Personalized Recommendation) involves several key steps to improve personalized recommendations using a multi-agent system. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1.

## Data Collection

Gather user data, including long-term preferences and session-specific behaviors.
2.

## User Understanding Agent

This agent analyzes the collected data to summarize user preferences, creating a profile that reflects both long-term and short-term interests.
3.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Use RAG to retrieve candidate items that might be relevant to the user based on the summarized preferences.
4.

## Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent

This agent evaluates how well the retrieved items align with the user's inferred intent, ensuring the recommendations are semantically relevant.
5.

## Context Summary Agent

Summarizes the findings from the NLI agent, providing a clear context for the next step.
6.

## Item Ranker Agent

Generates a ranked list of recommendations based on how well the items fit the user's context and preferences.
7.

## Evaluation

Test the ARAG framework on three different datasets to see how well it performs compared to standard RAG and other baseline methods.

The process is designed to be dynamic and adaptive, continuously updating the user's profile and recommendations based on new data.
