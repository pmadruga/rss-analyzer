Preference-Aligned Routing: Arch-Router guides model selection by matching queries to user-defined domains or action types, offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.

The Innovation: This 1.5B model outperforms top proprietary models in matching queries with human preferences, making routing decisions more transparent and flexible.
