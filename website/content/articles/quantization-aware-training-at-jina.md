Lossless Compression: Jina demonstrates how quantization-aware training can make embeddings 64x smaller while maintaining performance. This is crucial for deploying AI at scale with limited resources.

Technical Excellence: The approach combines output QAT with careful scaling strategies, achieving the best of both worlds: smaller embeddings without sacrificing quality.
