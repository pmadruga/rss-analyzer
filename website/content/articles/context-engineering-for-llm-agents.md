# Context Engineering for LLM Agents

The Central Metaphor: Think of Large Language Models as a new kind of operating system, where the LLM is like the CPU and its context window is like RAM. Just as your computer slows down when RAM is full, LLMs struggle when their context windows are overloaded.

The Four Pillars of Context Engineering:
1. Write Context: Just as you take notes while solving problems, agents need scratchpads and memories
2. Select Context: Not everything in your notes is relevant - context selection is like having a smart assistant who knows which files to pull
3. Compress Context: Sometimes you need to summarize War and Peace into a paragraph
4. Isolate Context: Complex tasks benefit from splitting context across specialized sub-agents

Why This Matters Now: As we build agents that can work for hours or days on complex tasks, context management becomes THE critical bottleneck. It's not about having the smartest model - it's about using its intelligence efficiently.

The Key Insight: Context engineering isn't just an optimization - it's fundamental to agent capability. We're moving from "prompt engineering" (what to say) to "context engineering" (what to remember and when).
