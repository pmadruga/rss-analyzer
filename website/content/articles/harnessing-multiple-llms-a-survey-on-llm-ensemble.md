# Harnessing Multiple LLMs: A Survey on LLM Ensemble

The Big Idea: Instead of relying on a single AI model, what if we could orchestrate multiple models to work together, each contributing their unique strengths? I'm proposing a comprehensive framework for "LLM Ensemble" - making multiple large language models collaborate like musicians in an orchestra.

Three Ways to Ensemble:
1. Ensemble-Before-Inference: Like having a pre-meeting where experts discuss strategy
2. Ensemble-During-Inference: Models work together in real-time, like a surgical team
3. Ensemble-After-Inference: Combining outputs after generation, like synthesizing multiple expert reports

The Challenge of Coordination: The hardest part isn't getting models to work - it's getting them to work TOGETHER effectively. How do you resolve disagreements? Prevent redundant work? Ensure models complement rather than interfere?

Why This Changes Everything: Single models have inherent biases and blind spots. By combining multiple models, we can compensate for individual weaknesses, achieve more reliable outputs, and handle more complex tasks.
