Universal Ranking: IRanker unifies diverse ranking tasks using a single model through reinforcement learning and iterative decoding. It decomposes complex ranking into step-by-step candidate elimination.

Broad Impact: A single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results across recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, even surpassing larger models on certain datasets.
