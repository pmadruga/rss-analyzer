## Model Selection

Arch-Router is a compact model with 1.5 billion parameters. This size was chosen to balance performance and efficiency, making it practical for real-time query routing.

2.

## Query Mapping

The model is designed to take a user query and map it to specific domains (like travel or finance) and action types (like booking a flight or checking account balances). This mapping is crucial for understanding the context of the query.

3.

## Preference Alignment

By matching queries to user-defined domains and actions, Arch-Router aligns routing decisions with human preferences. This makes the routing process more intuitive and effective.

4.

## Flexible Architecture

The system is designed to easily add new LLMs without retraining. This is achieved through a modular architecture that allows new models to be plugged in seamlessly.

5.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of Arch-Router was evaluated using conversational datasets. These datasets help in measuring how well the model matches queries with human preferences, focusing on subjective evaluation criteria.

6.

## Comparison with Proprietary Models

The researchers compared Arch-Router's performance against top proprietary models to ensure it achieves state-of-the-art results.

7.

## Transparency and Flexibility

The design ensures that routing decisions are transparent and flexible, allowing users to understand and adjust preferences as needed.

**Methodology:** The research methodology involved several key steps to develop and evaluate the Arch-Router system:

1.

## Identifying the Problem

The researchers recognized that current methods for routing queries to different large language models (LLMs) don't effectively capture human preferences and are limited to a small set of models.

2.

## Defining Preferences

They decided to focus on user-defined domains (like travel) and action types (like image editing) to better align routing decisions with human preferences.

3.

## Developing Arch-Router

The team created Arch-Router, a compact model with 1.5 billion parameters, designed to map user queries to these domain-action preferences.

4.

## Training the Model

Arch-Router was trained to understand and match queries to the appropriate domains and actions, which would then guide the selection of the most suitable LLM.

5.

## Testing and Evaluation

The model was tested on conversational datasets to see how well it matched queries with human preferences. This involved comparing its performance against other top models.

6.

## Adding New Models

The researchers ensured that Arch-Router could easily integrate new LLMs without needing to be retrained or modified, making the system flexible and scalable.
