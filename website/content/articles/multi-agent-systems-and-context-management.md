Advanced Context Engineering: This explores how multiple AI agents can work together effectively by managing their individual and shared contexts. Think of it as organizing a team where each member has their own workspace but can share important information when needed.

Key Technical Components: The system uses specialized routing, memory management, and coordination protocols to ensure agents don't step on each other's toes while maximizing their collective capabilities.
