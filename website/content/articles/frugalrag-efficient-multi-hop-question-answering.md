The Core Innovation: I've discovered that large language models don't need massive amounts of training to become better at retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). With just 1,000 carefully chosen examples, we can teach them to be nearly twice as efficient while maintaining the same accuracy!

The Two-Stage Magic: My approach works in two clever stages. Stage 1 teaches the model to recognize when it actually needs more information. Stage 2 trains it to reason through documents efficiently, connecting pieces of information without redundant searches.

Why This Matters: Current RAG systems are like students who run to the library every time they need to answer any part of a question. My system reduces retrieval calls by nearly 50% while maintaining competitive accuracy.

The Surprising Discovery: You don't need millions of examples to achieve this. With just 1,000 well-chosen training examples, the model learns the PATTERN of when retrieval is useful, not just memorizing specific cases.
