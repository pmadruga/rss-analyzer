# Text-to-LoRA: Instant Transformer Adaptation

Democratizing Model Specialization: Text-to-LoRA enables adapting large language models on the fly solely based on natural language descriptions. It's a hypernetwork that constructs LoRAs in a single inexpensive forward pass.

The Innovation: After training on just 9 pre-trained LoRA adapters, the system can match task-specific adapter performance and even generalize to entirely unseen tasks with minimal compute requirements.
