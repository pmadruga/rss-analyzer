Better RAG Evaluation: Introduces a framework for evaluating retrieval context in long-form RAG using human-written summaries to control information scope. This addresses a critical gap in how we measure RAG system effectiveness.

The CRUX Framework: Uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner, offering more reflective and diagnostic evaluation than traditional metrics.
