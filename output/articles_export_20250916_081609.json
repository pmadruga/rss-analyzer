The solution: **Create a shared Semantic ID space** that balances both tasks by fine-tuning a *bi-encoder* (a model that maps items and queries to the same embedding space) on *both* search and recommendation data.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a library where books are labeled in two ways:\n                - **Traditional IDs**: Random numbers (e.g., `Book #4729`).

This makes them poor at *embedding tasks* (e.g., search, clustering, semantic similarity), which require understanding context *bidirectionally* (like BERT does). Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask (breaking the LLM’s pretrained strengths), or\n                - Add extra input text (slow and expensive).\n\n                **Solution:** *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny BERT-style module to pre-process the input into a single *Contextual token* (like a summary). This token is fed into the LLM *before* the actual text, giving every token some bidirectional context *without* changing the LLM’s architecture or adding much compute overhead.
