The key finding is that these re-rankers often **fail to outperform simpler, keyword-based methods (like BM25)** when the query and documents don’t share obvious lexical (word-level) overlaps. In other words, they’re **tricked by surface-level word matches** rather than truly grasping deeper meaning.\n\n                **Analogy**:\n                Imagine a librarian (LM re-ranker) who’s supposed to find the *best* books for your question by understanding the *topic*. But instead, they just pick books with the most matching words in the title—even if those books are irrelevant.
