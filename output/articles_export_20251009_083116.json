This makes them poor at creating *bidirectional* embeddings (where context from both past *and* future tokens matters), which are critical for tasks like semantic search or clustering. Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask (breaking pretrained behavior), or\n                - Add extra input text (increasing compute costs).\n\n                **Solution**: *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny BERT-style module to pre-process the input into a single **Contextual token**, which is prepended to the LLM’s input. This token acts like a ‘cheat sheet’ of bidirectional context, letting the LLM generate better embeddings *without* changing its core architecture or adding much overhead.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re reading a mystery novel *one page at a time* (like a decoder-only LLM). To understand the plot, you’d need to flip back and forth (bidirectional attention). But if someone gave you a *one-sentence summary* of the entire chapter before you start (the Contextual token), you could follow along much better—even reading forward only. That’s what Causal2Vec does for LLMs.\n                \",\n                \"key_innovations\": [\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"Contextual Token Injection\",\n                        \"description\": \"\n                        A lightweight BERT-style encoder compresses the input into a *single token* containing bidirectional context.

The **Contextual token** (bidirectional summary), and\n                        2.

This is great for generation but bad for embeddings, where ‘cat’ in ‘a *cat* chased the dog’ needs to know about ‘dog’ too.\n                - **Causal2Vec’s trick**: The BERT-style encoder sees the *full input* (bidirectional) and distills it into one token. When this token is prepended, the LLM’s causal attention can ‘see’ it for *every* token in the sequence, effectively giving all tokens *some* bidirectional context—without violating causality.\n\n                ### Efficiency Gains\n                - **Sequence length reduction**: The BERT encoder processes the full text once, but the LLM only sees the Contextual token + original text (or a truncated version). For a 512-token input, the LLM might only process ~75 tokens (85% shorter).\n                - **Inference speedup**: Fewer tokens = fewer attention computations.
