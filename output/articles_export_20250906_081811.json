Existing systems (e.g., those using generic Knowledge Graphs like Wikidata or DBpedia) often fail because:\n                    - They lack **domain-specific nuance** (e.g., medical jargon vs. legal terminology).\n                    - They rely on **static or outdated knowledge** (e.g., pre-trained embeddings that don’t reflect recent advancements).\n                    - They struggle with **semantic ambiguity** (e.g., the word 'java' could mean coffee, programming, or an island).\",\n                    \"analogy\": \"Imagine searching for 'python' in a library.

Unlike traditional fine-tuning, it leverages the *in-context learning* capabilities of modern LLMs (like GPT-4 or Claude) to build agents that adapt dynamically without retraining. The key insight: **The context *is* the agent’s brain—shape it poorly, and the agent fails; shape it well, and it thrives.**\",\n\n                \"analogy\": \"Imagine teaching a student by giving them a textbook (the *context*). If the textbook is disorganized, missing key details, or cluttered with irrelevant info, the student will struggle—even if they’re brilliant. Context engineering is like designing the *perfect textbook* for the AI: highlighting critical passages (KV-cache optimization), adding sticky notes for focus (recitation), and leaving in the student’s mistakes (error retention) so they learn from them.\"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components\": {\n                \"components\": [\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"KV-Cache Optimization\",\n                        \"simple_definition\": \"A technique to reuse computed parts of the AI’s 'memory' (the *key-value cache*) to speed up repeated tasks and cut costs.

Without KV-cache optimization, every step would be as slow/costly as the first. Manus reduced costs by **10x** by stabilizing prompts and avoiding cache invalidation (e.g., no timestamps in system prompts).\",\n                        \"example\": \"If your agent’s prompt starts with `'You are a helpful assistant. Current time: 2025-07-19T12:34:56'`, the cache breaks every second. Manus uses static prefixes like `'You are a Manus agent.

If you ask it about a rare disease, a regular AI might give vague or wrong answers because it wasn’t trained deeply on medical texts. SemRAG fixes this by:\n                - **Breaking documents into meaningful chunks** (not just random sentences) using *semantic similarity* (e.g., grouping sentences about 'symptoms' together, not mixing them with 'treatment').\n                - **Building a knowledge graph** to map how concepts relate (e.g., 'Disease X' → 'causes' → 'Symptom Y' → 'treated by' → 'Drug Z'). This helps the AI 'understand' context better.\n                - **Retrieving only the most relevant chunks** when answering questions, like a librarian grabbing the exact books you need instead of dumping the whole shelf on you.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of SemRAG as a **super-organized filing cabinet for AI**:\n                - **Traditional RAG**: Throws all files into one drawer.
