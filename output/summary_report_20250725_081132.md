**Source:** [https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2025/the-big-llm-architecture-comparison.html](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2025/the-big-llm-architecture-comparison.html)

**Key Findings:** So, what did I find? First, while the core architecture of LLMs hasn't changed dramatically since GPT-2, there have been significant refinements. These refinements, like moving from MHA to GQA or MLA, and introducing MoE layers, have made models more efficient and capable.

Second, normalization layers play a crucial role in stabilizing training. Placing them before or after certain components can have a big impact on how well the model learns.

Third, positional embeddings aren't always necessary. Models like SmolLM3 show that you can achieve good performance without explicit positional information, relying instead on the inherent order of tokens.

Finally, the rise of MoE architectures in 2025 shows a trend towards more efficient and capable models. By using a mixture of experts, models can handle more complex tasks without a proportional increase in computational cost.

**Key Findings:** Our main discoveries were:

1. **Complexity Matters**: We found that the complexity of the knowledge representation significantly affects the LLM's performance. Simple representations were easier for the LLM to handle, but they didn't always provide enough detail. Complex representations were harder to handle but provided more accurate information.

2. **Balance is Key**: There's a trade-off between simplicity and detail. The best performance came from representations that were detailed enough to be accurate but simple enough for the LLM to understand and query efficiently.

3. **Adaptability**: The LLM showed the ability to adapt to different types of knowledge representations, but this adaptability came with a learning curve. The more complex the representation, the more training the LLM needed.

These findings are significant because they show that the way we structure knowledge can greatly impact how well AI systems can use it. This has implications for designing better AI systems that can retrieve and use information more effectively.

**Key Findings:** Our main discovery is that by breaking down the graph-based retrieval process into planning, verification, and execution, we can significantly improve both the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval. This is important because it means we can find the right information more quickly and with fewer mistakes, even in complex, interconnected datasets.

Specifically, we found that GraphRunner outperforms existing methods by 10-50% in terms of accuracy. This means we're much better at finding the right information. We also found that our approach reduces the cost of inference (the process of making predictions) by 3.0-12.9 times and the time it takes to generate a response by 2.5-7.1 times. This means our method is not only more accurate but also much faster and cheaper.

These findings are significant because they show that our multi-stage framework is a powerful tool for handling graph-based retrieval tasks. It addresses the fundamental problem of errors and hallucinations in existing methods, making it a more robust and efficient solution.

**Key Findings:** Our main discovery is that dynamic frameworks, where retrieval and reasoning work together, are much better at answering complex questions. It's like having a helpful librarian who understands your question and finds the right book, instead of just handing you something from the shelf.

We found that newer methods using dense vectors for retrieval and deep learning for reasoning outperform older, static methods. This is significant because it means we can build smarter, more efficient systems for finding and understanding information.

Connecting back to our original problem, this shift to dynamic frameworks solves the issue of static, disjointed retrieval and reasoning, making our 'robot librarian' much more effective.
