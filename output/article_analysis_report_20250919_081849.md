                "core_problem": {
                    "description": "The paper tackles a fundamental challenge in **Information Retrieval (IR)**: how to retrieve *semantically relevant* documents from diverse, heterogeneous data sources when the relationships between data and domain-specific knowledge are complex or poorly represented. Existing systems (e.g., those using generic Knowledge Graphs like DBpedia or Wikidata) often fail because:
                    - They lack **domain-specific nuance** (e.g., medical jargon vs. legal terminology).
                    - They rely on **static or outdated knowledge** (e.g., pre-trained embeddings that don’t reflect recent advancements).
                    - They struggle with **semantic gaps** between query intent and document content.",
                    "analogy": "Imagine searching for 'COVID-19 treatments' in 2020 using a system trained only on 2010 medical data. The results would miss critical context (e.g., repurposed drugs like dexamethasone) because the domain knowledge evolved."

                    "description": "The authors introduce **SemDR** (Semantic Document Retrieval), a system that combines:
                    1. **Group Steiner Tree Algorithm (GST)**: A graph-theoretic method to find the *minimum-cost connected subgraph* spanning a set of 'terminal nodes' (e.g., key concepts in a query). This helps identify the most *semantically coherent* path between query terms and documents.
                    2. **Domain Knowledge Enrichment**: Injects **dynamic, domain-specific knowledge** (e.g., curated ontologies, expert-validated relationships) into the retrieval process to bridge semantic gaps.
                    3. **Hybrid Representation**: Merges generic knowledge graphs (for broad coverage) with domain-specific graphs (for precision).",
                    "why_it_works": "GST acts like a 'semantic GPS'—it doesn’t just find documents with matching keywords but *optimizes the route* between query concepts and document content using domain-aware connections. For example, a query about 'quantum machine learning' would leverage both:
                    - **Generic links** (e.g., 'quantum' → 'physics', 'machine learning' → 'AI').
                    - **Domain links** (e.g., 'quantum' → 'qubit', 'machine learning' → 'variational circuits')."

                    "application_here": "The authors adapt GST to:
                    - **Model queries as terminal nodes** (e.g., 'diabetes' + 'AI').
                    - **Model documents as subgraphs** where edges represent semantic relationships (e.g., 'diabetes' → 'insulin resistance' → 'predictive models').
                    - **Minimize 'cost'** to prioritize documents with tight semantic alignment to the query.",
                    "example": "For the query 'climate change impact on coral reefs', GST might connect:

                    - 'coral reefs' → 'bleaching events' (domain link)

                    - **Curated ontologies** (e.g., Gene Ontology for biology, MeSH for medicine).
                    - **Expert-validated relationships** (e.g., 'drug A treats disease B' from clinical trials).
                    - **Dynamic updates** (e.g., integrating recent research papers into the knowledge graph).",
                    "contrast_with_existing_systems": "Most semantic IR systems (e.g., BM25 + BERT) treat domain knowledge as *static* or *generic*. SemDR treats it as:
                    - **Modular**: Swap in domain-specific graphs (e.g., law vs. medicine).

                    "metrics": "Precision (90%) and accuracy (82%)—significantly higher than baselines. The 18% error rate likely stems from:
                    - **Ambiguous queries** (e.g., 'Java' as programming language vs. island).

                - **Emerging topics**: New fields (e.g., 'AI ethics') lack representation in static knowledge graphs.
                - **Multidisciplinary queries**: E.g., 'How does blockchain apply to supply chain sustainability?' requires bridging CS, economics, and environmental science.",

                - **Medical literature search**: Finding clinical trials for rare diseases by understanding complex biomedical relationships.

                - Distributed computing (e.g., GraphX on Spark).",
                "knowledge_graph_maintenance": "Domain knowledge decays (e.g., medical guidelines update yearly). The system needs:

                - **Builds a map** (knowledge graph) of how 'exercise', 'BDNF', and 'Alzheimer’s' are linked in medical research.
                - **Finds the shortest path** (Group Steiner Tree) between these concepts in documents.

Think of it like a video game character that starts weak but gets smarter and more skilled the more you play, without you having to manually upgrade it.

                The big problem today is that most AI agents (like chatbots or virtual assistants) are *static*—they’re trained once and then stay the same, even if the world around them changes. This survey explores how to make agents *self-evolving*: they observe their environment, get feedback, and use that to *rewire their own brains* (so to speak) to perform better over time.

                - Passenger feedback (e.g., 'You braked too hard!'),

                This paper tackles a critical challenge in modern AI systems: **how to design item identifiers (IDs) that work seamlessly for *both* search and recommendation tasks when using generative AI models (like LLMs)**.

                Traditionally, systems use arbitrary unique IDs (e.g., `item_12345`) to represent items (e.g., products, videos, or documents). But these IDs lack meaning—like trying to describe a movie to a friend using only its Netflix catalog number. The paper proposes **Semantic IDs**: *meaningful*, learned representations (like discrete codes derived from embeddings) that capture an item’s *content* or *contextual role* (e.g., \"sci-fi movie with strong female lead\" instead of `tt0120338`).

                The key problem: **Can we create a single set of Semantic IDs that works well for *both* search (finding relevant items for a query) *and* recommendation (suggesting items to a user based on their history)?** Previous work often optimized IDs for one task, but the authors explore *joint* optimization.

                Imagine a library where books are labeled in two ways:
                - **Traditional IDs**: Each book has a random barcode (e.g., `BK-9843`). You’d need to scan every barcode to find a book about quantum physics.
                - **Semantic IDs**: Books are labeled with tags like `{'science', 'physics', 'quantum', 'Feynman', 'advanced'}`. Now, both a *search* for 'quantum mechanics' and a *recommendation* for someone who liked 'A Brief History of Time' can use the same tags efficiently.

                    - **Recommendation** relies on matching items to *user preferences* (e.g., 'this user buys Nike shoes and likes arch support').

    "extracted_title": "ParallelSearch: Train your LLMs to Decompose Query and Search Sub-queries in Parallel with Reinforcement Learning",

    "analysis": {
        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_idea": "ParallelSearch is a new way to teach AI models (specifically LLMs) how to break down complex search queries into smaller, independent parts that can be processed *simultaneously* instead of one after another. This is like teaching a librarian to send multiple assistants to fetch different books at the same time, rather than making them wait in line.",

                "why_it_matters": "Current AI search agents (like Search-R1) are slow because they handle each part of a query step-by-step, even when parts of the query don’t depend on each other. For example, if you ask, *'Compare the GDP of France and Japan in 2023 and list their top 3 exports,'* the AI could fetch France’s GDP and exports *at the same time* as Japan’s, but today’s systems do it sequentially. ParallelSearch fixes this by training the AI to spot these independent tasks and run them in parallel, saving time and computational resources.",

                "key_innovation": "The breakthrough is using **reinforcement learning (RL)** to teach the LLM two things:
                1. **How to split queries** into independent sub-queries (e.g., separating France’s data from Japan’s).
                2. **When to run them in parallel** without sacrificing accuracy.
                The RL system rewards the AI for correct answers *and* for efficiently decomposing and parallelizing the work."

                - Reserve a hotel,
                - Rent a car.
                Instead of doing these one after another (sequential), you ask three friends to handle each task simultaneously (parallel). ParallelSearch is like training an AI to *automatically* recognize which tasks can be delegated to ‘friends’ (sub-queries) and manage them efficiently.",

                "technical_parallel": "In computing, this is similar to how modern CPUs use **multithreading** to run multiple instructions at once. ParallelSearch brings this idea to AI-driven search, where the ‘threads’ are independent sub-queries processed by the LLM or external tools (e.g., web search APIs)."

                    - Sequential approach: Fetch LeBron’s height → Fetch Giannis’s height → Compare → Fetch LeBron’s PPG → Fetch Giannis’s PPG.

                         - Sub-query 1: Germany’s CO2 emissions in 2020.
                         - Sub-query 2: Canada’s CO2 emissions in 2020.
                    2. **Execute in parallel**: Run sub-queries concurrently using multiple LLM calls or external APIs.

                    - **Decomposition quality**: Were sub-queries logically independent and complete?
                    - **Parallel efficiency**: How much time/compute was saved by parallelizing?

                    "why_it_works": "The gains come from:
                    - **Reduced latency**: Parallel execution cuts total time (e.g., fetching 2 entities in parallel takes ~1x time vs. 2x sequentially).
                    - **Better resource use**: Fewer total LLM calls mean lower costs and faster responses.

                **Galileo** is a new AI model designed to understand *many types of remote sensing data* (like satellite images, radar, weather data, elevation maps, etc.) *all at once*. Unlike older models that focus on just one type of data (e.g., only optical images), Galileo can combine *diverse inputs* to solve problems like tracking crops, detecting floods, or monitoring glaciers—even when the objects of interest vary wildly in size (from tiny boats to massive glaciers) and speed (fast-moving storms vs. slow-changing landscapes).

                The key innovation is a **self-supervised learning** approach (no manual labels needed!) that:
                1. **Masks parts of the input data** (like hiding patches of an image or time steps in a series) and trains the model to reconstruct them.
                2. Uses **two contrastive losses** (a fancy way of saying it learns by comparing similar/dissimilar things):
                   - *Global loss*: Compares deep, abstract features of the data (e.g., 'this region looks like a forest').
                   - *Local loss*: Compares raw, low-level features (e.g., 'these pixels match the shape of a boat').
                3. Handles **multi-scale objects** by designing the masking strategy to focus on both tiny details (local) and broad patterns (global).
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine you’re a detective analyzing a crime scene. Older models are like specialists who only look at fingerprints (*one modality*) or only study the big picture (*one scale*). Galileo is like a team of detectives who:
                - Combine clues from fingerprints, security footage, weather reports, and topographic maps (*many modalities*).
                - Zoom in on tiny details (a smudged print) *and* step back to see the whole room (*multi-scale*).
                - Learn by playing a game: they cover up some clues and guess what’s missing (*masked modeling*), then check if their guesses match the real clues (*contrastive losses*).

                    - Optical images show water color, but clouds block the view → SAR sees through clouds.

        **Galileo is like a super-smart robot detective for satellite pictures!** It can look at *lots of different kinds of maps* (regular photos, radar, weather, etc.) all at once to find things like floods, crops, or boats. Instead of just memorizing examples, it plays a game: it covers up parts of the map and tries to guess what’s missing, like peek-a-boo! It’s really good at spotting tiny things (like a little boat) *and* huge things (like a melting glacier) because it practices looking at both the big picture *and* the tiny details. This makes it better than older robots that only know one type of map or one size of object."

            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_concept": "Context engineering is the art and science of structuring the input (context) given to AI agents (like Manus) to maximize their performance, efficiency, and adaptability. Unlike traditional fine-tuning, which modifies the model itself, context engineering focuses on *how* you present information to the model—leveraging its in-context learning abilities to achieve better results faster and cheaper.",

                "analogy": "Imagine teaching a student (the AI agent) by giving them a textbook (the context). You can:
                - **Highlight key sections** (KV-cache optimization) so they don’t waste time rereading.
                - **Use sticky notes** (file system as context) to offload details they don’t need to memorize.
                - **Show them past mistakes** (keeping errors in context) so they learn to avoid repeating them.
                - **Avoid giving them a rigid script** (few-shot pitfalls) that might limit their creativity.
                The textbook’s *organization* matters more than the student’s innate ability (the model’s parameters).",

                "why_it_matters": "For AI agents, context engineering is the difference between:
                - A system that’s slow, expensive, and brittle (e.g., fine-tuning for every task).
                - A system that’s fast, scalable, and adaptable (e.g., Manus handling complex tasks with minimal latency by optimizing context)."
            },

                "principle_1": {
                    "name": "Design Around the KV-Cache",
                    "explanation": "The **KV-cache** (key-value cache) stores intermediate computations during LLM inference. Reusing cached tokens avoids recomputing them, drastically reducing cost and latency. For agents, where context grows with each action (e.g., `user input → tool call → observation → repeat`), KV-cache hit rate becomes critical.",
                    "example": {
                        "bad": "Including a timestamp like `Current time: 2025-07-18 14:23:47` in the system prompt invalidates the cache every second, forcing full recomputation.",
                        "good": "Using a stable prefix (e.g., `System: You are Manus, an AI agent.`) and appending only new actions/observations preserves the cache.",
                        "impact": "Claude Sonnet charges **10x more** for uncached tokens ($3/MTok vs. $0.30/MTok). For an agent with 100:1 input-output ratio, this saves ~90% on costs."
                    },
                    "technical_deep_dive": {
                        "cache_breakpoints": "Some frameworks (e.g., vLLM) require manual cache breakpoints. For example:
                        ```python
                        # Bad: Dynamic timestamp breaks cache
                        prompt = f\"Time: {datetime.now()}\nSystem: ...\"

                        # Good: Static prefix + append-only
                        prompt = \"System: ...\n\" + new_actions
                        ```",
                        "deterministic_serialization": "JSON libraries may reorder keys (e.g., `{'a':1, 'b':2}` vs. `{'b':2, 'a':1}`), breaking the cache. Use `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)` to enforce consistency."
                    }
                },

                "principle_2": {
                    "name": "Mask, Don’t Remove (Dynamic Action Spaces)",
                    "explanation": "As an agent’s toolset grows (e.g., 100+ tools), dynamically adding/removing tools mid-task breaks the KV-cache and confuses the model (e.g., referencing a tool no longer in context). Instead, **mask token logits** to restrict actions without altering the context.",
                    "example": {
                        "problem": "User adds 200 custom tools. The agent starts hallucinating actions like `{'name': 'nonexistent_tool'}` because the model sees inconsistent tool definitions.",
                        "solution": "Manus uses a **state machine** to mask logits:
                        - **Auto mode**: Model can choose any action (prefill: `<|im_start|>assistant`).
                        - **Required mode**: Must call a tool (prefill: `<|im_start|>assistant<tool_call>`).
                        - **Specified mode**: Must pick from a subset (prefill: `<|im_start|>assistant<tool_call>{'name': 'browser_'`).
                        ",
                        "tool_naming": "Prefix tools by category (e.g., `browser_open`, `shell_exec`) to enable group-level masking without complex logic."
                    },
                    "why_it_works": "Logit masking is **cache-friendly** (no context changes) and **model-agnostic** (works with any LLM supporting constrained decoding)."
                },

                "principle_3": {
                    "name": "Use the File System as Context",
                    "explanation": "LLM context windows (e.g., 128K tokens) are insufficient for real-world tasks (e.g., processing 100-page PDFs). Instead of truncating/compressing (which loses data), treat the **file system as external memory**. The agent reads/writes files on demand, reducing context bloat.",
                    "example": {
                        "before": "Context includes a full webpage (50K tokens), hitting limits and degrading performance.",
                        "after": "Context stores only the URL (`https://example.com/page`). The agent fetches content later via `file_read('page.html')`.",
                        "restorable_compression": "Critical data (e.g., URLs, file paths) stays in context; non-critical data (e.g., raw HTML) is offloaded to files."
                    },
                    "future_implications": "This approach mimics **Neural Turing Machines** (2014), where models interact with external memory. State Space Models (SSMs) could leverage this to overcome their weak long-range attention."

                "principle_4": {
                    "name": "Manipulate Attention Through Recitation",
                    "explanation": "LLMs suffer from **‘lost-in-the-middle’** issues—forgetting early goals in long contexts. **Recitation** (repeating key info) biases attention toward critical tasks.",

                        "manus_todo_list": "For a task with 50 steps, Manus maintains a `todo.md`:

                        - [ ] Clean outliers
                        - [ ] Generate report
                        ```
                        After each action, it updates the list, pushing the **current goal** to the end of the context (where the model attends most).",
                        "why_it_works": "Recitation exploits the **recency bias** in transformer attention. It’s a form of **self-prompting** without architectural changes."

                    "explanation": "Hiding errors (e.g., retries, state resets) deprives the model of learning signals. **Exposing failures** (e.g., stack traces, error messages) helps the model adapt.",
                    "example": {
                        "bad": "Agent fails to fetch a URL, so the system silently retries. The model never learns that `curl -X POST` might work better than `GET`.",

                        ```

                        ```
                        Now the model is **10x less likely** to repeat the mistake.",

                    "explanation": "Few-shot examples create **imitation bias**: the model mimics the pattern of past actions, even if suboptimal. For agents, this leads to **drift** (e.g., repeating the same resume-review steps verbatim).",
                    "example": {

                        - Vary serialization (e.g., `skills: ['Python']` vs. `{'skills': ['Python']}`).
                        - Reorder observations.

                **SemRAG is a smarter way to help AI answer questions by combining two key ideas:**
                - **Semantic Chunking**: Instead of splitting documents into arbitrary chunks (e.g., fixed-length paragraphs), SemRAG uses *sentence embeddings* (mathematical representations of meaning) to group sentences that are *semantically similar*. This ensures retrieved information is coherent and relevant to the query.
                - **Knowledge Graphs (KG)**: It organizes retrieved information into a graph of connected entities (e.g., 'Paris' → [capital_of] → 'France'). This helps the AI understand *relationships* between concepts, not just isolated facts.

                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves noisy or irrelevant chunks. SemRAG filters and structures this data *without fine-tuning the LLM*, making it cheaper, faster, and more accurate for specialized domains (e.g., medicine, law).

                - **Traditional RAG**: Dumps a pile of random paragraphs from papers (some about coral, some about unrelated ocean chemistry).
                - **SemRAG**:
                  1. *Semantic Chunking*: Groups sentences about 'coral bleaching' together, separate from 'ocean acidification' (even if they’re in the same paper).
                  2. *Knowledge Graph*: Links 'coral bleaching' → [caused_by] → 'rising sea temperatures' → [linked_to] → 'carbon emissions'. The AI now *understands the chain of causality*, not just keywords.

                **Problem**: Decoder-only LLMs (like those used in chatbots) are great at generating text but struggle with *embedding tasks*—turning text into meaningful numerical vectors for search, clustering, or similarity comparison. Existing fixes either:
                - Break the model’s original design (e.g., removing the 'causal mask' that makes them unidirectional), *or*
                - Add extra text input to compensate, making them slower and more expensive.

                **Solution**: *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny **BERT-style 'Contextual token'** to the *start* of the input sequence. This token acts like a 'summary' of the entire text, letting the LLM 'see' contextual hints *without* needing bidirectional attention or longer sequences. It also combines the last hidden states of this Contextual token + the EOS token to reduce 'recency bias' (where the model over-values the end of the text).

                "core_idea": "This research introduces a **multiagent AI system** that automatically generates high-quality *chain-of-thought (CoT)* training data to improve large language models' (LLMs) adherence to safety policies. Instead of relying on expensive human annotators, the system uses *ensembles of AI agents* to collaboratively create, refine, and validate CoTs that embed policy compliance into the reasoning process. The key innovation is a three-stage pipeline—**intent decomposition**, **deliberative refinement**, and **policy-aligned post-processing**—which outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods by **29% on average** across benchmarks like safety, jailbreak robustness, and overrefusal reduction.",

                "analogy": "Imagine teaching a student (the LLM) to solve math problems *and* explain their steps (CoT). Instead of a single teacher (human annotator), you assemble a *panel of expert tutors* (AI agents). The first tutor breaks down the problem’s hidden assumptions (*intent decomposition*), the panel debates and corrects the solution step-by-step (*deliberation*), and a final editor ensures the explanation aligns with classroom rules (*refinement*). This collaborative process produces better 'textbook examples' (training data) than one teacher working alone."

                "description": "The paper addresses a critical gap in evaluating **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems. While RAG combines retrieval (fetching relevant documents) with generation (LLMs producing answers), existing evaluation methods are either:
                - **Manual** (time-consuming, subjective, e.g., human judgment),
                - **Automated but narrow** (focus only on retrieval or generation in isolation, ignoring their interplay),
                - **Proxy metrics** (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) that fail to capture RAG’s unique challenges like *hallucinations*, *retrieval relevance*, or *answer faithfulness* to sources.

                The authors argue that **no unified, automated framework exists** to holistically evaluate RAG systems across these dimensions.",
                "motivation": "RAG is widely used (e.g., in chatbots, search engines, legal/medical QA), but poor evaluation leads to:
                - Deploying systems that hallucinate or miscite sources,

                1. **Smart aggregation** of token embeddings (e.g., averaging or using the [CLS] token equivalent in decoder-only models).
                2. **Prompt engineering** tailored for clustering tasks (e.g., adding instructions like *'Represent this sentence for clustering:'* to guide the LLM’s focus).
                3. **Lightweight contrastive fine-tuning** using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to teach the model to distinguish similar vs. dissimilar texts *without* updating all parameters.

                The result? **State-of-the-art performance on clustering tasks** (tested on the *Massive Text Embedding Benchmark*) while using far fewer computational resources than full fine-tuning.",

                - **Add a ruler attachment** (prompt engineering) to guide how it measures.
                - **Sharpen just the blade tip** (LoRA contrastive fine-tuning) to improve accuracy for specific measurements.
                - **Average multiple measurements** (token aggregation) to reduce noise.
                The knife now measures as well as a specialized ruler, but you didn’t have to melt it down and recast it."

                This paper introduces **HALoGEN**, a benchmark to systematically measure and classify **hallucinations** in large language models (LLMs). Hallucinations are false or misleading statements generated by LLMs that conflict with real-world knowledge or input context. The challenge is that detecting these errors manually is slow and expensive, so the authors built an **automated framework** to:
                - Test LLMs across **9 diverse domains** (e.g., programming, science, summarization) using **10,923 prompts**.
                - Break LLM outputs into **atomic facts** (small, verifiable claims) and check them against **high-quality knowledge sources** (e.g., databases, ground-truth references).
                - Classify hallucinations into **3 types**:
                  - **Type A**: Errors from *misremembering* training data (e.g., incorrect dates, names).
                  - **Type B**: Errors from *inherent flaws* in training data (e.g., outdated or wrong facts in the corpus).
                  - **Type C**: Complete *fabrications* (e.g., inventing fake references or events).

                Imagine a student writing an essay. HALoGEN is like a teacher who:
                1. Gives the student **9 different topics** to write about (domains).
                2. **Underlines every factual claim** in the essay (atomic facts).
                3. **Fact-checks each claim** against a textbook (knowledge source).
                4. Labels mistakes as either:
                   - *Misremembering* (Type A: 'The Battle of Hastings was in 1067' instead of 1066),
                   - *Bad textbook* (Type B: The textbook itself said 1067),
                   - *Making things up* (Type C: 'Napoleon had a pet dragon').
                The paper finds that even the *best* LLMs get **up to 86% of atomic facts wrong** in some domains—like a student acing grammar but flunking history.

                    - **Programming**: Does generated code work? (e.g., incorrect API calls).
                    - **Scientific attribution**: Are citations accurate? (e.g., fake paper references).
                    - **Summarization**: Does the summary match the source? (e.g., invented details).

                    - *Atomic facts*:
                      1. `sorted()` uses Timsort. (True)

The authors propose a solution inspired by medical triage—**prioritizing legal cases based on their potential 'criticality'** (i.e., how influential or precedent-setting they might become). The key innovation is a **dataset and methodology to predict which cases will become 'Leading Decisions' (LDs) or highly cited**, using **algorithmic labels** instead of expensive manual annotations.

                In simpler terms: *Can we teach a computer to spot which court rulings will matter the most in the future, so judges can focus on those first?*",

                "analogy": "Think of it like a **legal 'viral post' predictor**: Just as social media algorithms guess which posts will go viral, this system predicts which court decisions will be widely cited (i.e., 'go viral' in the legal world). The twist? It does this **without humans manually labeling thousands of cases**—instead, it uses citation patterns and publication status as proxies for importance."

        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_question": "The paper asks whether **low-confidence annotations** (e.g., labels, predictions, or judgments) generated by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—where the model itself is uncertain about its output—can still be **aggregated or processed** to produce **high-confidence conclusions** (e.g., reliable datasets, decisions, or insights).",

                "analogy": "Imagine a room of 100 experts who are each 60% sure about their individual answers to a question. Even though no single expert is highly confident, if you combine their answers in a smart way (e.g., voting, weighting by partial confidence, or statistical modeling), the *group’s* answer might be 95% accurate. The paper explores whether this works for LLMs too.",

                "why_it_matters": "LLMs often generate outputs with **probability distributions** (e.g., 'this text is 70% likely to be toxic'). Discarding low-confidence outputs wastes data, but using them naively risks errors. This research could enable **cheaper, scalable annotation pipelines** by leveraging 'weak' LLM signals instead of expensive human labeling or high-confidence-only filtering."

                    - Low-probability entity extractions

                    - **Probabilistic modeling**: Treating annotations as distributions, not binary labels.
