This makes them *bad* at creating **embeddings** (dense vector representations of text meaning), because embeddings need to understand *full context* (e.g., 'bank' in 'river bank' vs. 'bank account').\n\n                **Existing Fixes**:\n                - **Bidirectional Hacks**: Remove the causal mask to let the LLM see future tokens (like BERT), but this *breaks* the LLM’s pretrained knowledge.\n                - **Extra Text Tricks**: Add prompts like 'Summarize this text:' to force the LLM to process meaning, but this *slows down* inference and adds noise.\n\n                **Causal2Vec’s Solution**:\n                1. **Add a 'Contextual Token'**: Use a tiny BERT-style model to pre-process the input text into *one special token* that holds the gist of the whole sentence. Stick this token at the start of the LLM’s input.\n                   - *Why?* Now, even with causal attention, every token can 'see' this context token (like a cheat sheet) to understand the full meaning.\n                   - *Example*: For 'The cat sat on the mat', the context token might encode that this is about a *physical action*, not a metaphor.\n\n                2. **Better Pooling**: Instead of just using the *last token* (which biases toward the end of the sentence, e.g., 'mat' in the example), combine the *context token* and the *EOS (end-of-sentence) token* to balance meaning.\n                   - *Why?* The EOS token has the LLM’s final 'thought', while the context token has the big picture.\n\n                **Results**:\n                - **Faster**: Cuts input length by 85% (less tokens to process) and speeds up inference by 82%.\n                - **Better**: Beats other methods on the *MTEB benchmark* (a test for text embeddings) *without* using private data—just public retrieval datasets.\n                - **Plug-and-Play**: Works with any decoder-only LLM (e.g., Llama, Mistral) *without* retraining the whole model.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re reading a mystery novel *one word at a time* (causal attention).

This is called a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. The problem? Evaluating whether these systems are actually *good* is hard. Existing methods either:\n                - Rely on humans to manually check answers (slow and expensive), or\n                - Use automated metrics that don’t capture real-world usefulness (e.g., does the answer *actually* help a user?).\n\n                This paper introduces **ARES**, a framework to *automatically* evaluate RAG systems in a way that mimics how humans would judge them. It focuses on three key aspects:\n                1. **Faithfulness**: Does the generated answer *truthfully* reflect the retrieved information?\n                2. **Answerability**: Is the question even *answerable* with the retrieved data?\n                3. **Helpfulness**: Does the answer *actually solve the user’s problem*?\n\n                ARES uses **large language models (LLMs)** to simulate human evaluation, but with structured rules to avoid hallucinations or bias.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of ARES like a *robot teacher* grading student essays:\n                - **Faithfulness**: Did the student copy facts correctly from the textbook?

LLMs are trained on human text, and humans *also* use jargon to obfuscate (e.g., corporate doublespeak, political evasion).\n                \"\n            }\n        },\n\n        \"critique_of_original_post\": {\n            \"strengths\": \"\n            - **Concise framing**: The post distills a complex paper into a **tweet-sized insight** ('flooding with bullshit jargon') that’s immediately intuitive.\n            - **Actionable link**: Points to the [404 Media article](https://www.404media.co/researchers-jailbreak-ai-by-flooding-it-with-bullshit-jargon/), which likely provides deeper context.\n            - **Hashtag use**: #MLSky signals the audience (machine learning researchers on Bluesky), increasing relevance.\n            \",\n            \"missed_opportunities\": \"\n            - **No technical details**: The post doesn’t mention *how* the citations are fabricated (e.g., are they randomly generated?
