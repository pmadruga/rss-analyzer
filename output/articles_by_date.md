**Methodology:**
The research methodology for GraphRunner involves a three-stage framework designed to make graph-based retrieval more efficient and accurate. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Planning Stage**: In this first step, the framework creates a high-level plan for how to navigate or 'traverse' the graph. This plan outlines the steps needed to find the relevant information without getting lost in the details.

2. **Verification Stage**: Before executing the plan, GraphRunner checks it against the structure of the graph and a set of predefined rules. This step helps catch any mistakes or 'hallucinations' (false information) that might have been introduced during the planning stage.

3. **Execution Stage**: Once the plan is verified, GraphRunner carries it out. This involves actually moving through the graph to retrieve the needed information. By separating the planning from the execution, the framework can handle multiple steps at once, making it faster and more reliable.

In simple terms, think of it like planning a road trip. First, you map out your route (planning). Then, you double-check your map to make sure you haven’t made any mistakes (verification). Finally, you hit the road and follow your map (execution).

**Technical Approach:**
GraphRunner uses several technical components to achieve its goals. Here’s a detailed explanation of each part and how they work together:

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: These are advanced AI models that understand and generate human language. In GraphRunner, LLMs are used to help plan the traversal of the graph. However, LLMs can sometimes make mistakes or 'hallucinate' (generate false information), which is why the verification stage is crucial.

2. **Graph Structure**: The graph is a structured dataset where information is connected in a network of nodes and edges. Understanding these connections is key to accurate retrieval.

3. **Traversal Actions**: These are the steps or moves that the framework takes to navigate the graph. GraphRunner introduces high-level traversal actions that allow it to explore multiple steps (or 'hops') in the graph at once, making the process more efficient.

4. **Verification Mechanism**: This component checks the traversal plan against the graph structure and predefined rules to catch any errors introduced by the LLMs. It acts as a safeguard to ensure the plan is accurate before execution.

5. **Execution Engine**: Once the plan is verified, the execution engine carries out the traversal actions to retrieve the needed information. By separating planning from execution, GraphRunner can handle complex queries more efficiently.

These components work together to make GraphRunner more accurate and efficient. The LLMs provide the initial plan, the verification mechanism ensures the plan is correct, and the execution engine carries out the plan.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings show that GraphRunner outperforms existing methods by 10-50% in performance. It also reduces inference costs by 3.0-12.9x and response generation time by 2.5-7.1x, making it more efficient and robust for graph-based retrieval tasks.

**Processed:** 2025-07-16 08:07:42  
**Methodology:**
The research methodology involves surveying various approaches to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning systems within Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the research was conducted:

1. **Literature Review**: The researchers started by gathering and reviewing existing studies and papers on RAG and reasoning systems. This involved reading academic articles, technical reports, and other relevant documents.

2. **Identifying Trends**: They analyzed the gathered information to identify trends and shifts in the field, particularly the move from static 'retrieval-then-reasoning' methods to more dynamic frameworks.

3. **Categorization**: The researchers categorized the different approaches and frameworks used in RAG and reasoning systems.

4. **Comparison**: They compared the various methods to understand their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their applicability in different scenarios.

5. **Documentation**: The findings were documented in a survey paper, which provides an overview of the current state of RAG and reasoning systems in LLMs.

6. **Resource Compilation**: Additionally, they compiled a list of resources and tools related to RAG and reasoning systems, which is available on GitHub.

The goal of this methodology is to provide a comprehensive overview of the field, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to understand the current landscape and choose the right tools for their needs.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach focuses on understanding and comparing different RAG and reasoning systems used in LLMs. Here's a detailed explanation of the technical components:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: RAG is a technique used to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. It works by first retrieving relevant information from a large dataset (like a database or the internet) and then using that information to generate a response. This makes the model's responses more accurate and contextually relevant.

2. **Reasoning Systems**: Reasoning systems are designed to enable LLMs to perform complex reasoning tasks. They allow the model to understand and generate responses that require logical thinking, common sense reasoning, and problem-solving.

3. **Static vs Dynamic Frameworks**: Initially, many systems used a static 'retrieval-then-reasoning' approach. This means they first retrieved information and then performed reasoning on that information. However, more recent systems use dynamic frameworks, which allow retrieval and reasoning to happen simultaneously and interactively.

4. **Tools and Resources**: The researchers have compiled a list of tools and resources related to RAG and reasoning systems. These include libraries, frameworks, and models that can be used to implement these systems. Some of these tools are available on the GitHub repository linked in the post.

5. **Deep Reasoning**: Deep reasoning refers to the ability of LLMs to perform complex, multi-step reasoning. This is achieved by combining advanced reasoning techniques with the retrieval capabilities of RAG systems.

The technical components work together to create systems that can generate accurate, contextually relevant, and logically sound responses. The shift to dynamic frameworks is particularly important as it allows for more flexible and interactive responses.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings of the research include the identification of a shift from static retrieval-then-reasoning methods to dynamic frameworks in RAG and reasoning systems within LLMs. The survey also highlights the advantages of using deep reasoning techniques for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs.

1. **Identify Context Components**: The first step is to identify what makes up the context for an AI agent. This includes things like the system prompt (instructions for the AI), user input, short-term memory (chat history), long-term memory, information from knowledge bases, tools and their definitions, responses from tools, structured outputs, and global state/context.

2. **Select Relevant Context**: Decide which of these components are most relevant for the task at hand. This involves choosing the right knowledge bases or tools that the AI can use.

3. **Optimize Context Window**: Since the context window (the space where information is provided to the AI) is limited, techniques like context summarization and ordering are used to make the most of this space. For example, retrieving and sorting information by date to ensure the AI gets the most relevant data first.

4. **Implement Long-Term Memory**: For applications that require ongoing conversations, implement long-term memory storage. This can be done using different memory blocks like VectorMemoryBlock, FactExtractionMemoryBlock, or StaticMemoryBlock, which store and retrieve relevant information over time.

5. **Use Structured Information**: Provide structured outputs to the AI to ensure it gets the most relevant information without overcrowding the context window. This can be done using tools like LlamaExtract, which extracts relevant data from complex sources.

6. **Design Workflows**: Create workflows that break down complex tasks into focused steps, each with its own optimized context window. This prevents context overload and ensures that the AI has the right information at each step.

7. **Test and Iterate**: Continuously test and refine the context engineering process to ensure the AI performs tasks effectively.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach involves using various tools and frameworks to implement context engineering. Here’s a detailed explanation of the technical components and how they work together:

LlamaIndex provides a retrieval infrastructure and workflow orchestration framework, while LlamaCloud offers powerful enterprise tools like LlamaExtract and LlamaParse.

2. **Knowledge Base and Tool Selection**: Before retrieving additional context, the AI is provided with information about available tools or knowledge bases. This ensures the AI chooses the right resources for the task.

3. **Context Ordering and Compression**: Techniques like context summarization and ordering are used to optimize the context window. For example, a function called 'search_knowledge' retrieves and sorts information by date to provide the AI with the most relevant data.

4. **Long-Term Memory Storage**: LlamaIndex provides different memory blocks for long-term memory storage, such as VectorMemoryBlock, FactExtractionMemoryBlock, and StaticMemoryBlock. These blocks store and retrieve relevant information over time, ensuring the AI has access to past conversations or data.

5. **Structured Information**: Structured outputs are used to provide the AI with the most relevant information without overcrowding the context window. LlamaExtract is a tool that extracts structured data from complex sources, ensuring the AI gets condensed, relevant information.

6. **Workflow Engineering**: LlamaIndex Workflows provide an event-driven framework for designing workflows. This framework allows for defining explicit step sequences, controlling context strategically, ensuring reliability with validation and error handling, and optimizing for specific outcomes. Workflows prevent context overload by breaking down complex tasks into focused steps.

7. **Implementation Details**: The implementation involves using Python for coding the retrieval and sorting functions, and integrating various memory blocks and tools into the workflow. The workflow framework ensures that each step in the process is optimized for the AI’s context window.

**Key Findings:**
The main discoveries from the research include the importance of context engineering in building effective AI agents. By carefully selecting and optimizing the context provided to the AI, it can perform tasks more effectively. Techniques like context summarization, ordering, and the use of structured information are crucial for making the most of the limited context window. Additionally, the use of workflows to break down complex tasks into focused steps ensures that the AI has the right information at each step.

**Source:** https://blog.langchain.com/the-rise-of-context-engineering/  
**Processed:** 2025-07-16 08:08:43  
**Methodology:**
The methodology of context engineering involves several key steps to ensure that a Large Language Model (LLM) has the right information and tools to accomplish a task effectively. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Gathering Context**: Context can come from various sources such as the application developer, the user, previous interactions, tool calls, or external data. This step involves collecting all relevant information that the LLM might need.

2. **Dynamic System Integration**: Since context can change dynamically, the system needs to be flexible enough to integrate new information as it becomes available. This means the logic for constructing the final prompt for the LLM must be dynamic and adaptable.

3. **Ensuring Relevant Information**: The LLM needs to be provided with the right information to perform its task. This step involves filtering and selecting the most relevant data from the gathered context.

4. **Providing Necessary Tools**: Sometimes, the LLM might need additional tools to complete its task, such as tools to look up more information or perform specific actions. This step involves ensuring that the LLM has access to these tools.

5. **Formatting Communication**: How information is presented to the LLM matters. This step involves formatting the context and tool inputs in a way that is easy for the LLM to understand and use.

6. **Evaluating Task Feasibility**: Before sending the context and tools to the LLM, it's important to ask if the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task with the provided information and tools. This helps in identifying and fixing potential failure modes.

7. **Iterative Refinement**: Based on the LLM's performance, the context and tools can be refined iteratively to improve the outcomes.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach of context engineering involves several components working together to support the LLM:

1. **LangGraph**: This is a controllable agent framework that allows developers to decide what steps are run, what goes into the LLM, and where outputs are stored. It enables full control over the context engineering process.

2. **LangSmith**: This is an observability and evaluation solution for LLM applications. It allows tracing of agent calls, providing visibility into the steps that gather data for the LLM, the exact inputs and outputs, and the tools the LLM has access to. This helps in debugging and ensuring that the LLM has all the relevant information and tools.

3. **Tools for External Information Access**: These are tools that the LLM can use to access external information. They are designed to return information in a format that is easily digestible for the LLM.

4. **Memory Management**: This includes short-term memory (summarizing ongoing conversations) and long-term memory (fetching user preferences from previous interactions). These help in providing the LLM with relevant context from past interactions.

5. **Prompt Engineering**: This involves clearly enumerating instructions for how the agent should behave in the prompt. It's a subset of context engineering, focusing on how context is assembled in the prompt.

6. **Dynamic Retrieval**: This involves fetching information dynamically and inserting it into the prompt before calling the LLM. It ensures that the LLM has the most up-to-date information.

These technical components work together to provide the LLM with the right context and tools, formatted in a way that the LLM can understand and use effectively.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings from the article include the importance of context engineering in building reliable LLM applications. Most failures in agentic systems are due to inadequate context or poor formatting of inputs. Providing the right information and tools in the right format is crucial for the LLM's performance. Context engineering is becoming a critical skill for AI engineers as LLM applications evolve from single prompts to more complex, dynamic systems.

**Source:** https://bsky.app/profile/arxiv-cs-ir.bsky.social/post/3lto4qcwxly2j  
**Processed:** 2025-07-16 08:09:43  
**Methodology:**
The researchers aimed to evaluate how well different methods of assessing relevance in information retrieval (IR) systems work. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of their methodology:

1. **Gathering Data**: They collected data from IR systems, which included queries (search terms) and documents, along with human-labeled relevance assessments (qrels). These qrels indicate how relevant a document is to a query.

2. **Generating Alternative Qrels**: To compare different methods, they generated alternative qrels using various relevance assessment techniques.

3. **Comparing Systems**: They compared pairs of IR systems to see if one performed significantly better than the other based on the qrels.

4. **Identifying Errors**: They measured two types of errors in their comparisons:
   - **Type I Errors**: False positives, where they incorrectly conclude that one system is better than another.
   - **Type II Errors**: False negatives, where they fail to detect a real difference between systems.

5. **Calculating Metrics**: They used balanced classification metrics, like balanced accuracy, to summarize the overall ability of the qrels to correctly identify differences between systems.

**Processed:** 2025-07-16 08:10:12  
**Methodology:**
The research methodology involved a technique called 'InfoFlood.' Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it was conducted:

1. **Identify Target Queries**: Researchers first identified specific queries that they wanted the Large Language Models (LLMs) to respond to in a way that bypasses safety filters.
2. **Transform Queries**: These targeted queries were then transformed into complex prose. This means they rewrote the queries using complicated sentences and academic-sounding language.
3. **Add Fabricated Citations**: To make the complex prose seem more legitimate, researchers added fake academic citations. These citations were made up to look like real references to scientific papers.
4. **Feed to LLM**: The transformed queries with fabricated citations were then fed into the LLM.
5. **Observe Response**: Researchers observed how the LLM responded to these complex, jargon-filled inputs and noted whether the safety filters were bypassed.

The goal was to see if the LLM could be tricked into providing responses that it normally wouldn't due to its safety filters.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach revolved around exploiting the LLM's reliance on superficial cues for detecting toxic or inappropriate content. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Superficial Cues**: LLMs often use simple patterns or keywords to detect toxic content. For example, certain words or phrases might automatically trigger a safety filter.
2. **Complex Prose Generation**: By transforming simple queries into complex, academic-sounding language, the researchers aimed to confuse the LLM's detection mechanisms. This involved using sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures that the LLM might not easily recognize as problematic.
3. **Fabricated Citations**: Adding fake academic citations made the complex prose seem more credible. This step was crucial because it added a layer of authenticity, making it harder for the LLM to flag the content as suspicious.
4. **InfoFlood Technique**: The combination of complex prose and fabricated citations created an 'InfoFlood.' This overwhelming amount of seemingly legitimate information was designed to bypass the LLM's safety filters.
5. **Implementation**: The researchers likely used programming tools and scripts to automate the process of generating complex prose and adding fabricated citations. They then fed these inputs to the LLM through its API (Application Programming Interface), which is a way to interact with the model programmatically.

The technical components worked together to create a deceptive input that the LLM struggled to flag as inappropriate, thereby 'jailbreaking' it.

**Key Findings:**
The main discovery was that LLMs can be tricked into bypassing their safety filters by using complex, jargon-filled language with fabricated academic citations. This method, called 'InfoFlood,' exploits the model's reliance on superficial cues for toxicity detection.

**Processed:** 2025-07-16 08:10:34  
**Methodology:**
The research team aimed to create a system that can efficiently build and retrieve information from knowledge graphs, which are like maps of information, from unstructured text. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how they did it:

1. **Text Processing**: They started with large amounts of unstructured text, which is text that doesn't have a predefined format, like sentences in a document.
2. **Entity and Relation Extraction**: Using advanced language processing tools (NLP libraries), they identified important entities (like names, dates, places) and the relationships between them in the text.
3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: These entities and relationships were then organized into a knowledge graph, which is a structured way to represent information.
4. **Graph Retrieval**: To quickly find information in this graph, they developed a method that combines identifying key points (query nodes) with a efficient search strategy (one-hop traversal).
5. **Evaluation**: They tested their system on two datasets related to legacy code migration to see how well it performed compared to traditional methods.

The key innovation here is that they didn't use large language models (LLMs) for constructing the knowledge graph, which are usually very resource-intensive.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach involves several key components working together:

1. **NLP Libraries**: Industrial-grade Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries were used to extract entities and relations from the text. These libraries are like advanced dictionaries that understand the context and meaning of words.
2. **Dependency-Based Knowledge Graph Construction**: Instead of using LLMs, they relied on the NLP libraries to build the knowledge graph. This method is called 'dependency-based' because it focuses on the dependencies (relationships) between words and phrases.
3. **Hybrid Query Node Identification**: This is a technique to identify the most relevant nodes (points) in the graph based on a query (question or search term).
4. **Efficient One-Hop Traversal**: Once the key nodes are identified, the system quickly searches the graph by moving one step (hop) at a time to find related information. This ensures fast and accurate information retrieval.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: They used metrics like LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS to compare their system's performance with traditional methods.

These components were chosen to make the system scalable and cost-efficient, reducing the reliance on resource-intensive LLMs while maintaining high performance.

**Key Findings:**
The system achieved up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional methods based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. The dependency-based construction approach performed almost as well as LLM-generated knowledge graphs (94% of the performance) but with significantly reduced cost and improved scalability.

### Context Engineering
**Source:** https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/  
**Processed:** 2025-07-16 08:11:03  
**Methodology:**
The research methodology involves a process called 'context engineering,' which is about managing the information that an AI agent needs to perform tasks effectively. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how this is done:

1. **Identify Context Types**: The first step is to understand the different types of context that an AI agent needs. This includes instructions (like prompts and tool descriptions), knowledge (facts and memories), and feedback from tool calls.

2. **Engineer Context**: The next step is to engineer the context, which involves four main strategies:
   - **Write Context**: Save important information outside the AI's immediate memory (context window) so it can be used later. This is like taking notes.
   - **Select Context**: Pull relevant information into the AI's immediate memory when it's needed. This is like referring to your notes when you need them.
   - **Compress Context**: Summarize or trim information to keep only what's necessary, reducing the amount of data the AI has to process.
   - **Isolate Context**: Split information into smaller, manageable parts, which can be handled by different parts of the AI or even by multiple AI agents working together.

3. **Implement Strategies**: Use tools and frameworks to put these strategies into action. For example, use 'scratchpads' to write context, 'memories' to select context, summarization for compressing context, and multi-agent systems for isolating context.

4. **Evaluate and Iterate**: Finally, test how well the context engineering strategies are working and make improvements as needed. This involves tracking how much data the AI is using and seeing if the strategies help the AI perform better.

The research uses a framework called LangGraph to implement and test these context engineering strategies.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach involves several key components and tools working together to manage the context for AI agents:

1. **LangGraph Framework**: This is the main tool used to implement context engineering. It allows for both short-term and long-term memory management, helping to write, select, compress, and isolate context.

2. **Scratchpads and Memories**: Scratchpads are used to save information temporarily, like taking notes during a task. Memories are used to store information long-term, like remembering important facts across multiple tasks.

3. **Summarization and Trimming**: To compress context, summarization techniques are used to distill important information. Trimming involves removing less important data to keep the context manageable.

4. **Multi-Agent Systems**: For isolating context, multi-agent systems are used. These systems split tasks among multiple AI agents, each with its own context window. This helps manage large amounts of information more efficiently.

5. **Tool Selection**: Tools like RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) are used to select the most relevant tools for a task, ensuring the AI agent has the right information at the right time.

6. **State Objects and Sandboxes**: State objects store context information and can be designed to isolate certain data from the AI until it's needed. Sandboxes are used to run code or tools in a separate environment, further isolating context.

7. **LangSmith for Evaluation**: LangSmith is used to track data usage and evaluate the performance of the context engineering strategies. This helps identify areas for improvement and ensures the strategies are effective.

These technical components work together to create a system where the AI agent has just the right information at each step, improving its performance and efficiency.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings are that context engineering is crucial for improving the performance of AI agents. By carefully managing the context window, AI agents can handle complex tasks more efficiently. Strategies like writing, selecting, compressing, and isolating context are effective in managing the information load and improving agent performance.
