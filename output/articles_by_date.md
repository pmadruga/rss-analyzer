**Source:** https://blog.langchain.com/the-rise-of-context-engineering/  
**Processed:** 2025-07-14 08:07:46  
**Methodology:**
The methodology of context engineering involves several key steps to ensure that a Large Language Model (LLM) can effectively accomplish a task. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Gathering Context**: Collect information from various sources such as the developer, user, previous interactions, tool calls, or external data. This ensures the LLM has all the necessary information to perform its task.
2. **Dynamic System Construction**: Since context can come in dynamically, the system must be flexible enough to integrate new information on the fly. This means the prompt given to the LLM is not static but changes based on the incoming data.
3. **Formatting Information**: The way information is presented to the LLM matters. Clear and concise formatting, such as short descriptive messages, is more effective than large, complex data structures like JSON blobs.
4. **Providing Tools**: Equip the LLM with the right tools to perform tasks that cannot be accomplished with the input data alone. These tools could be for looking up information, taking actions, or other functionalities.
5. **Evaluating Plausibility**: Continuously ask if the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task with the given context and tools. This helps in identifying whether the failure is due to lack of information or tools, or if the model itself is at fault.

The goal is to create a dynamic and adaptable system that provides the LLM with the right information and tools in the right format, ensuring it can perform its tasks effectively.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach of context engineering involves several components working together to support the LLM:

1. **LangGraph**: A framework that allows for complete control over the agent's steps, inputs, and outputs. This enables precise context engineering by deciding what goes into the LLM and how the outputs are stored.
2. **LangSmith**: A tool for observing and evaluating LLM applications. It traces agent calls, showing the steps taken to gather data and the exact inputs and outputs to the LLM. This helps in debugging and ensuring that the LLM has all the necessary information and tools.
3. **Tools and Formatting**: The format of the information and the tools provided to the LLM are crucial. Tools should be designed to return information in a way that is easily digestible for the LLM. Short, descriptive messages are preferred over complex data structures.
4. **Dynamic Prompt Construction**: The prompt given to the LLM is dynamically constructed based on the incoming context. This ensures that the LLM always has the most relevant and up-to-date information.
5. **Context Sources**: Context can come from various sources like the developer, user, previous interactions, tool calls, or external data. Pulling these together involves a complex system that can handle dynamic inputs.

These technical components work together to create a robust system that supports the LLM in performing its tasks effectively. The choice of these components is driven by the need to provide complete and structured context to the LLM, ensuring it can perform optimally.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings highlight the importance of context engineering in ensuring the reliability of LLM applications. Most failures in agentic systems are due to inadequate context or poor formatting of the information provided to the LLM. Context engineering is becoming a crucial skill for AI engineers as LLM applications evolve into more complex, dynamic systems.

**Processed:** 2025-07-14 08:08:01  
**Methodology:**
The research methodology for FrugalRAG involves a two-stage training framework aimed at improving the efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-hop question answering (QA). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Problem Identification**: The researchers identified that current methods for answering complex questions from large document collections are inefficient, especially in terms of the number of retrieval searches required.

2. **Baseline Setup**: They started with a standard ReAct pipeline, which is a combination of retrieval and reasoning steps. This pipeline retrieves relevant documents and then reasons through them to find an answer.

3. **Prompt Engineering**: The team improved the prompts used in the ReAct pipeline to guide the model more effectively during the retrieval and reasoning process.

4. **Two-Stage Training**:
   - **Stage 1**: The model is trained using a small set of examples (1000 training examples) to learn how to retrieve and reason efficiently.
   - **Stage 2**: The model is further fine-tuned using supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to optimize the number of retrieval searches needed.

5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on benchmarks like HotPotQA to ensure it achieves competitive RAG metrics while reducing the number of retrieval searches.

The goal is to make the model more frugal by reducing the latency and cost associated with multiple retrieval searches.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach of FrugalRAG involves several key components working together:

1. **ReAct Pipeline**: This is the core framework that combines retrieval and reasoning. It retrieves relevant documents from a large corpus and then reasons through them to generate an answer.

2. **Improved Prompts**: The prompts are carefully designed to guide the model better. These prompts help the model understand what kind of information to look for and how to reason through the retrieved documents.

3. **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: In this stage, the model is trained on a small set of labeled examples to learn the best ways to retrieve and reason. This helps the model become more efficient without needing large-scale fine-tuning.

4. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: RL techniques are used to further optimize the model. The model learns to minimize the number of retrieval searches by receiving feedback on its performance and adjusting its strategy accordingly.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance is measured using RAG metrics such as accuracy and recall, as well as the number of retrieval searches. This ensures that the model is both effective and efficient.

6. **Base Model**: The same base model is used throughout the process to ensure consistency and to demonstrate that improvements come from the training framework rather than changes in the model itself.

These components work together to create a system that can answer complex questions efficiently, reducing the cost and latency associated with multiple retrieval searches.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings are:
1. Large-scale fine-tuning is not necessary to improve RAG metrics. A standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
2. Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can significantly reduce the number of retrieval searches, achieving competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost.

### arxiv cs.IR (@arxiv-cs-ir.bsky.social)
**Source:** https://bsky.app/profile/arxiv-cs-ir.bsky.social/post/3lto4qcwxly2j  
**Processed:** 2025-07-14 08:08:24  
**Methodology:**
The researchers aimed to evaluate how well different methods of assessing relevance in information retrieval (IR) systems work. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of their approach:

1. **Gathering Data**: They collected data from IR systems, which include queries (questions people ask) and documents (the answers the system provides).
2. **Human Labeling**: Experts labeled these query-document pairs to indicate how relevant the documents are to the queries.
3. **Comparing Methods**: The team then compared different ways of assessing relevance to see which ones are most effective.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: They performed statistical tests to check for errors in these assessments, focusing on Type I (false positives) and Type II (false negatives) errors.
5. **Calculating Metrics**: The researchers used metrics like balanced accuracy to summarize the overall effectiveness of each relevance assessment method.

By following these steps, the researchers could determine which methods are best at correctly identifying when one IR system is better than another.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical components of this research involve several key concepts and tools:

1. **Query-Document Pairs**: These are the basic units of data, where a query is a search term and a document is a result returned by the IR system.
2. **Relevance Assessments (qrels)**: These are judgments made by humans about how relevant a document is to a query. They are crucial for evaluating IR systems.
3. **Statistical Tests**: The researchers used statistical methods to compare different sets of qrels. Specifically, they looked at Type I and Type II errors:
   - **Type I Errors**: These occur when the test falsely indicates a significant difference between systems (false positives).
   - **Type II Errors**: These occur when the test fails to detect a real difference (false negatives).
4. **Balanced Accuracy**: This is a metric that combines the results of Type I and Type II error analyses to give a single, easily comparable number that summarizes the overall effectiveness of the qrels.

The researchers chose these tools and methods because they provide a comprehensive way to evaluate the performance of IR systems. By quantifying both types of errors and using balanced accuracy, they can get a clear picture of how well different relevance assessment methods work.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings are that quantifying Type II errors provides additional insights into the effectiveness of relevance assessments. Using balanced accuracy as a metric gives a straightforward summary of how well different methods perform.

**Processed:** 2025-07-14 08:08:53  
**Methodology:**
The research methodology involved a technique called 'InfoFlood.' Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it was conducted:

1. **Identify Target Queries**: The researchers first identified specific queries that they wanted the Large Language Models (LLMs) to respond to, even if those queries were normally restricted or filtered out.

2. **Transform Queries**: They transformed these targeted queries into complex and elaborate prose. This means they rephrased the queries using complicated language and academic jargon.

3. **Add Fabricated Citations**: To make the queries seem more legitimate, the researchers added fake academic citations. These citations were designed to look like real references to scholarly work.

4. **Feed to LLM**: The transformed queries with fabricated citations were then fed into the LLM. The idea was to see if the model would process these queries differently.

5. **Observe Responses**: The researchers observed how the LLM responded to these complex, jargon-filled queries. They looked at whether the model's safety filters were bypassed and if it generated responses that it normally wouldn't.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach revolved around exploiting the LLM's reliance on superficial cues for detecting toxic or restricted content. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Understanding LLM Filters**: LLMs have safety filters that look for certain keywords or patterns to block inappropriate content. These filters often rely on simple, surface-level indicators.

2. **Complex Prose Generation**: The researchers used algorithms to generate complex prose. These algorithms took simple queries and turned them into complicated sentences filled with academic jargon. The goal was to make the queries look sophisticated and hard to understand.

3. **Fabricating Citations**: To enhance the legitimacy of the complex prose, the researchers created fake academic citations. These were added to the queries to make them appear more credible and scholarly.

4. **Bypassing Filters**: By transforming the queries into complex prose with fabricated citations, the researchers aimed to confuse the LLM's safety filters. The idea was that the filters would not recognize the underlying restricted content because it was hidden behind elaborate language and fake references.

5. **Implementation**: The transformed queries were input into the LLM using standard interfaces. The researchers then analyzed the outputs to see if the model generated responses that it normally wouldn't due to its safety filters.

The technical components worked together to create a 'Trojan horse' effect, where the restricted content was disguised as complex, academic language to bypass the LLM's defenses.

**Key Findings:**
The main discovery was that LLMs could be 'jailbroken' or tricked into processing restricted queries by transforming them into complex prose with fabricated academic citations. This method, called 'InfoFlood,' successfully overwhelmed the model's safety filters.

**Source:** https://bsky.app/profile/reachsumit.com/post/3ltgncqpysk2j  
**Processed:** 2025-07-14 08:09:15  
**Methodology:**
The research methodology involves several key steps to create and use knowledge graphs efficiently from unstructured text for large-scale Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The process starts with collecting unstructured text data, which could be anything from documents to code snippets.
2. **Entity and Relation Extraction**: Using industrial-grade Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries, the system identifies important entities (like names, dates, or concepts) and their relationships within the text.
3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: These entities and relations are then organized into a knowledge graph, a structured format that shows how different pieces of information are connected.
4. **Graph Retrieval**: To quickly find relevant information, the system uses a lightweight retrieval strategy. It identifies key query nodes and performs a one-hop traversal, which means it looks at directly connected nodes to fetch the most relevant data.
5. **Evaluation**: The system is tested on SAP datasets to see how well it performs compared to traditional methods.

The goal is to make this process scalable and cost-effective, especially for large enterprises.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach revolves around two main innovations:

1. **Dependency-Based Knowledge Graph Construction**:
   - **Tools Used**: Industrial-grade NLP libraries (specific ones aren't mentioned, but think of them as advanced text analysis tools).
   - **How It Works**: These libraries analyze the text to find entities (important words or phrases) and their relationships. For example, in a sentence like 'John wrote a book about AI', 'John' and 'book' are entities, and 'wrote' is the relation.
   - **Why This Approach**: It eliminates the need for large language models (LLMs), which are expensive and resource-intensive.

2. **Lightweight Graph Retrieval**:
   - **Components**: Hybrid query node identification and one-hop traversal.
   - **How It Works**: When the system needs to find information, it first identifies the most relevant nodes (hybrid query node identification). Then, it only looks at the nodes directly connected to these key nodes (one-hop traversal) to fetch the relevant data quickly.
   - **Why This Approach**: This method ensures high recall (finding most of the relevant data) with low latency (quick response time).

**Implementation Details**: The system is implemented and tested on SAP datasets, which include tasks like legacy code migration. The framework is designed to be practical and adaptable to different domains.

**Algorithm Choice**: The choice of algorithms and tools is driven by the need for scalability and cost-efficiency, making the system suitable for real-world enterprise applications.

**Key Findings:**
The research found that the new framework improves performance over traditional methods by up to 15% and 4.35% based on different metrics. The dependency-based construction approach achieved 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs while being much more cost-effective and scalable.

### Context Engineering
**Source:** https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/  
**Processed:** 2025-07-14 08:09:37  
**Methodology:**
The research methodology involves a process called 'context engineering,' which is about managing the information an AI agent needs to perform tasks effectively. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how this is done:

1. **Identify Context Types**: The first step is to understand the different types of context that an AI agent needs. This includes instructions (like prompts and examples), knowledge (facts and memories), and feedback from tools the agent uses.

2. **Write Context**: Save important information outside the agent's immediate memory (context window) so it can be used later. This is like taking notes. For example, an agent might save its plan in a 'scratchpad' or create long-term 'memories' that persist across sessions.

3. **Select Context**: Pull relevant information into the agent's immediate memory when needed. This involves choosing the right notes or memories that will help the agent complete its task. For instance, the agent might retrieve specific instructions or facts from its memory.

4. **Compress Context**: Simplify the information to fit within the agent's memory limits. This can involve summarizing long interactions or trimming less important details. For example, after many steps, the agent might summarize its actions to free up memory space.

5. **Isolate Context**: Split the information into manageable parts to avoid overwhelming the agent. This can involve using multiple agents, each with its own memory, or using separate environments (like sandboxes) to handle specific tasks.

6. **Evaluate and Iterate**: Use tools like LangSmith to track how well the context engineering is working and make improvements. This involves looking at data, tracking memory usage, and testing different approaches to see what works best.

By following these steps, researchers can help AI agents manage information more effectively, improving their performance on complex tasks.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach involves several strategies and tools to manage context for AI agents. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each component:

1. **Scratchpads and Memories**: These are tools for saving information outside the agent's immediate memory. Scratchpads are like temporary notes, while memories are long-term storage. For example, Anthropicâ€™s multi-agent researcher uses a scratchpad to save plans, and tools like ChatGPT use memories to store user interactions across sessions.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This technique helps select the most relevant information for a task. It can be used to fetch the most relevant tools or knowledge from a large database. For instance, code agents use RAG to retrieve specific code snippets or facts.

3. **Summarization and Trimming**: These are methods for compressing context. Summarization involves using an AI model to distill the most important information, while trimming involves removing less important details based on predefined rules. For example, Claude Code uses auto-compact to summarize interactions when the memory limit is reached.

4. **Multi-Agent Systems and Sandboxes**: These are techniques for isolating context. Multi-agent systems split tasks among multiple agents, each with its own memory. Sandboxes are separate environments where specific tasks can be performed without overwhelming the main agent. For instance, HuggingFaceâ€™s CodeAgent uses sandboxes to handle complex tool calls.

5. **LangGraph and LangSmith**: These are frameworks that support context engineering. LangGraph provides tools for writing, selecting, compressing, and isolating context. It uses a state object to manage information at each step of the agent's process. LangSmith helps track memory usage and evaluate the effectiveness of context engineering.

These technical components work together to ensure that AI agents have the right information at the right time, improving their ability to perform complex tasks efficiently.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings are that context engineering is crucial for improving the performance of AI agents. By effectively managing context, agents can handle long-running tasks, avoid memory overload, and select the most relevant information for each step of their process. Tools like LangGraph and LangSmith are instrumental in implementing and evaluating these strategies.

### GlÃ³rIA: A Generative and Open Large Language Model for Portuguese Pre-print - Accepted for publication at PROPOR 2024.
**Source:** https://arxiv.org/html/2402.12969v1  
**Processed:** 2025-07-14 08:10:09  
**Methodology:**
The research team aimed to create a large language model specifically for the Portuguese language, which they named GlÃ³rIA. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how they conducted their research:

1. **Data Collection**: The first step was to gather a massive amount of text data in Portuguese. This data came from various sources like books, websites, and articles to ensure the model would understand a wide range of topics and styles.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Once the data was collected, it needed to be cleaned up. This involved removing any unnecessary characters, correcting spelling errors, and organizing the text so the model could easily process it.

3. **Model Training**: The cleaned data was then used to train the language model. This is similar to teaching a student by showing them lots of examples. The model learns patterns and rules from the data, such as grammar and common phrases.

4. **Fine-Tuning**: After the initial training, the model was fine-tuned. This means adjusting the modelâ€™s settings to make it better at specific tasks, like generating coherent sentences or understanding context.

5. **Evaluation**: Finally, the model was tested to see how well it performed. This involved giving it new tasks to complete, like translating sentences or generating text, and checking the results for accuracy and coherence.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach involved several key components working together to create and train the GlÃ³rIA model:

1. **Transformer Architecture**: The model uses a type of neural network called a transformer. Think of it as a complex brain that can process and understand text. Transformers are good at handling large amounts of data and understanding the context of words.

2. **Tokenization**: Before the model can process text, it needs to be broken down into smaller pieces called tokens. These can be words or even parts of words. The team used a method called Byte-Level BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) for this, which is efficient and works well with the Portuguese language.

3. **Training Algorithm**: The model was trained using an algorithm that adjusts the modelâ€™s settings based on how well it performs. This is like a teacher correcting a studentâ€™s mistakes. The specific algorithm used is called AdamW, which is known for its efficiency and effectiveness.

4. **Frameworks and Tools**: The team used popular machine learning frameworks like PyTorch to build and train the model. PyTorch is like a toolbox that provides all the necessary tools to create and train neural networks.

5. **Hardware**: Training large language models requires powerful computers. The team used GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which are much faster than regular CPUs for this kind of task.

All these components work together to create a model that can understand and generate Portuguese text. The transformer architecture processes the tokenized text, the training algorithm adjusts the modelâ€™s settings, and the frameworks and hardware make it all possible.

**Key Findings:**
The main findings of the research were that the GlÃ³rIA model performed well in generating coherent and contextually appropriate Portuguese text. It showed promising results in various natural language processing tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness as a large language model for Portuguese.
