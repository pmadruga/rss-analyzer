Each sensor gives us a different piece of the puzzle. Our goal is to combine all these pieces to understand what's happening on the Earth's surface, whether it's tracking the growth of crops or detecting floods.

The challenge is that these sensors provide data in very different forms, and the things we're interested in can be tiny, like a boat,...","Our main discovery is that a single, generalist model can outperform specialized models designed for specific tasks. This is significant because it means we can use one model to tackle a wide range of remote sensing problems, from crop mapping to flood detection.

We found that our model, Galileo, performed better than state-of-the-art specialist models across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks. This shows that our approach of learning shared representations from diverse data modalities is ...","To understand our technical approach, let's break it down into simpler components:

1. **Transformer Architecture**: Think of a transformer as a factory with many workers (attention mechanisms) that can handle different tasks (modalities) simultaneously. Each worker focuses on a part of the task but communicates with others to ensure the whole job gets done.

1. **Data Selection**: We chose a wide range of data modalities to ensure our model could handle different types of information. This included multispectral optical data, synthetic aperture radar, elevation data, weather data, and more.

2. **Model Architecture**: We designed a multimodal transformer that could process all these data ..."
Context Engineering for AI Agents: Lessons from Building Manus,https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus,2025-08-03T09:26:34+00:00,2025-08-05 08:07:49,"At the start of the Manus project, we faced a critical decision: should we train an end-to-end agentic model from scratch using open-source foundations, or build an agent leveraging the in-context learning abilities of advanced models like GPT-3 and Flan-T5? In the early days of NLP, models like BERT required fine-tuning and evaluation before they could be applied to new tasks, a process that took weeks per iteration. This slow feedback loop was a deal-breaker for fast-moving applications. We...","Our main discoveries and results were:
1. **Efficiency through KV-Cache**: Improving the KV-cache hit rate significantly reduced latency and cost, making the agent more efficient.
2. **Stable Action Space**: Using logit masking to manage the action space prevented cache invalidation and model confusion, leading to more stable and predictable agent behavior.
3. **Scalable Context Management**: Treating the file system as the ultimate context allowed the agent to handle large observations and a...","Our technical implementation revolved around several key principles:
1. **KV-Cache Optimization**: We ensured that the KV-cache hit rate was maximized by keeping the prompt prefix stable and making the context append-only. This involved avoiding modifications to previous actions or observations and ensuring deterministic serialization.
2. **Logit Masking**: Instead of dynamically adding or removing tools, we used logit masking to manage the action space. This was implemented using response pr...","Our research design involved several key steps:
1. **Initial Decision**: We chose to build an agent leveraging the in-context learning abilities of advanced models rather than training an end-to-end model from scratch.
2. **Iterative Experimentation**: We adopted an iterative approach, rebuilding our agent framework multiple times as we discovered better ways to shape context.

HALoGEN: Fantastic LLM Hallucinations and Where to Find Them,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292,2025-07-31T00:00:35+00:00,2025-08-05 08:10:38,"Imagine you're in a library with thousands of books, but some books have incorrect or made-up information. You want to find out which books are reliable and which ones aren't. This is similar to what we're doing with large language models (LLMs). LLMs can generate impressive text, but sometimes they produce 'hallucinations'—statements that don't align with known facts or the given context. Our goal is to measure these hallucinations efficiently.

Here's how we approached it step-by-step:

1. **Prevalence of Hallucinations**: Even the best-performing LLMs produced a significant number of hallucinations. In some domains, up to 86% of the generated atomic facts were inaccurate. This is like finding out that even the most reputable librarians sometimes give wrong information.

This is significant because it challenges the assumption that LM re-rankers are always better at understanding semantic information.

We found that LM re-rankers often make mistakes when the words in the question and the document don't match up well (lexical dissimilarities).

1. **BM25 Baseline**: This is our traditional librarian. BM25 works by scoring documents based on how often the query words appear in them, adjusted by the length of the document and other factors. It's like checking how many times the keywords from your question appear in each document.
