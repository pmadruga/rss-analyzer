Can Unconfident LLM Annotations Be Used for Confident Conclusions?,https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15204v2,2025-07-24T12:36:13+00:00,2025-07-28 08:07:38,"Imagine you're trying to teach a robot to understand human language, but the robot is not very confident about its answers. This is similar to what we face with Large Language Models (LLMs)—they can generate text but aren't always sure if they're right. Our goal is to figure out if we can still use these uncertain answers to draw confident conclusions.

1. **Identify Unconfident Annotations**: First, we needed to understand what makes an annotation 'unconfident.'...","Our main discovery was that even uncertain annotations from LLMs can be useful. When combined, these uncertain annotations can lead to more confident conclusions. This is significant because it means we don't have to discard uncertain data; we can still use it to improve our understanding.

This addresses ...","Think of the LLM as a complex machine that processes language. Here's how we broke down our technical approach:

If the confidence score was below this threshold, we marked the annotation as uncertai...","We designed our study to answer the question: 'Can we use uncertain LLM annotations to draw confident conclusions?'
