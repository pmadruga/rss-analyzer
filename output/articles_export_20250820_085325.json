Think of it like a video game character that starts weak but gets smarter and more skilled the more you play, except here, the 'character' is an AI system, and the 'game' is real-world tasks (e.g., diagnosing diseases, writing code, or managing investments).\n\n                The problem today is that most AI agents are **static**: they’re built once, deployed, and never change, even if the world around them does. This survey explores how to make agents **dynamic**—able to evolve based on feedback, just like humans learn from mistakes.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a chef (the AI agent) who starts with a basic cookbook (foundation model).

This paper asks: *How can we create Semantic IDs that work for both?*\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re organizing a library:\n                - **Traditional IDs**: Each book has a random barcode (e.g., `BK-9834`). The librarian must memorize every barcode to find books.\n                - **Semantic IDs**: Each book has a label like `SCIFI-HARD_2020-AI-ETHICS`. Now, even a new librarian can infer that a user who liked `SCIFI-SOFT_2019-ALIENS` might also enjoy `SCIFI-HARD_2020-AI-ETHICS`—without seeing those exact books before.\n                The paper is essentially asking: *What’s the best way to design these labels so they work for both finding books by topic (search) and suggesting books to readers (recommendation)?*\n                \"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components\": {\n                \"problem_space\": {\n                    \"challenge\": \"\n                    - **Task-specific embeddings**: Models trained only for search (e.g., matching queries to documents) or only for recommendation (e.g., predicting user clicks) develop *biased* embeddings. A search embedding might focus on keyword overlap, while a recommendation embedding might prioritize user behavior patterns. Neither generalizes well to the other task.\n                    - **Joint modeling**: A single generative model (e.g., an LLM) now needs to handle *both* tasks. If the Semantic IDs are task-specific, the model’s performance degrades when switching between search and recommendation.\n                    \",\n                    \"example\": \"\n                    A movie like *The Matrix* might have:\n                    - A **search embedding** highlighting terms like *cyberpunk*, *action*, *Keanu Reeves*.\n                    - A **recommendation embedding** highlighting *user clusters* who watch it (e.g., sci-fi fans, 90s nostalgia viewers).\n                    A Semantic ID based only on search might fail to capture why users who liked *Inception* would also enjoy *The Matrix*.\n                    \"\n                },\n                \"proposed_solution\": {\n                    \"approach\": \"\n                    The paper explores **three strategies** for creating Semantic IDs in a joint setting:\n                    1. **Task-specific Semantic IDs**: Separate IDs for search and recommendation (e.g., `search_matrix = [SCIFI, ACTION, KEANU]` and `rec_matrix = [USER_CLUSTER_42, HIGH_RATING]`).\n                       - *Problem*: The generative model must juggle two ID spaces, increasing complexity.\n                    2. **Cross-task Semantic IDs**: A *single* ID space derived from embeddings trained on *both* tasks (e.g., `matrix = [SCIFI, ACTION, USER_CLUSTER_42]`).\n                       - *Goal*: Capture shared semantic signals (e.g., *scifi* is useful for both search queries and recommendations).\n                    3. **Bi-encoder fine-tuning**: Use a **bi-encoder model** (a dual-encoder architecture) fine-tuned on *both* search and recommendation data to generate embeddings, then discretize them into Semantic IDs.\n                       - *Why?* Bi-encoders are efficient for retrieval tasks and can balance both objectives.\n                    \",\n                    \"key_finding\": \"\n                    The **bi-encoder fine-tuned on both tasks** (strategy 3) worked best.

The 'context' is everything the agent 'sees' at each step—its instructions, past actions, tool definitions, and observations.

This makes them poor at *bidirectional* tasks like semantic search or text embeddings, where understanding context from *both directions* (e.g., 'bank' in 'river bank' vs. 'financial bank') is critical.\n\n                **Existing Solutions**:\n                - **Bidirectional Hacks**: Remove the causal mask to enable bidirectional attention, but this *breaks* the LLM’s pretrained knowledge (like forcing a one-way street to suddenly handle two-way traffic).\n                - **Extra Text Tricks**: Add prompts like 'Summarize this text:' to coax the LLM into better embeddings, but this *increases compute cost* (longer sequences = more money/time).\n\n                **Causal2Vec’s Solution**:\n                1. **Pre-encode with a Tiny BERT**: Before feeding text to the LLM, a lightweight BERT-style model compresses the *entire input* into a single **Contextual token** (like a 'summary pill' of the text’s meaning).\n                2. **Prepend the Token**: This Contextual token is placed at the *start* of the LLM’s input sequence. Now, even with causal attention, every token can 'see' this context *indirectly* (like giving a student a cheat sheet before an exam).\n                3. **Smart Pooling**: Instead of just using the last token’s output (which biases toward the *end* of the text), combine the Contextual token’s final state with the EOS (end-of-sequence) token’s state. This balances *global context* (from BERT) with *local focus* (from the LLM).\n\n                **Result**: The LLM now generates embeddings *almost as good as bidirectional models* but:\n                - **85% shorter sequences** (faster/cheaper).\n                - **No architecture changes** (works with any decoder-only LLM like Llama or Mistral).\n                - **SOTA performance** on public benchmarks (MTEB) for models trained on open datasets.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re teaching a student (the LLM) who can only read a book *left-to-right* and can’t peek ahead.

Traditional GraphRAG uses a librarian (LLM) to read every book and manually create a card catalog (knowledge graph)—slow and costly. This paper instead uses a **rule-based scanner (NLP tools)** to auto-generate the catalog by spotting keywords (entities) and their connections (relations), then adds a 'quick-find' system (one-hop traversal) to fetch relevant books instantly. The result? 94% as good as the librarian’s catalog, but 10x faster and cheaper.\"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components\": {\n                \"problem\": {\n                    \"description\": \"GraphRAG is powerful for multi-hop reasoning (e.g., 'Find all Java functions affected by a database schema change in 2010') but suffers from two bottlenecks:\n                    1. **Costly KG construction**: LLMs are used to extract entities/relations from text, which is slow and expensive at scale.\n                    2. **Slow retrieval**: Traversing large graphs for answers introduces latency.\",\n                    \"example\": \"For SAP’s legacy code migration, analyzing millions of lines of code with LLMs would be prohibitively expensive.\"\n                },\n\n                \"solution\": {\n                    \"1_dependency_based_KG_construction\": {\n                        \"how\": \"Replaces LLMs with **industrial NLP libraries** (e.g., spaCy, Stanza) to extract:\n                        - **Entities**: Nouns/phrases (e.g., 'DatabaseSchema', 'JavaMethod').\n                        - **Relations**: Verbs/dependencies (e.g., 'calls', 'modifies') from **syntactic dependency trees** in text.\n                        \",\n                        \"why\": \"NLP tools are deterministic, fast, and domain-adaptable.
