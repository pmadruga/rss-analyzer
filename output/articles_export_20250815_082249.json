Feed those chunks to an LLM to generate an answer.\n\n                **The problems:**\n                - **Semantic Islands**: High-level summaries (e.g., *'quantum chemistry'* and *'protein folding'*) are disconnected. The system doesn’t *explicitly* know how they relate, so it can’t reason across them (e.g., linking quantum simulations of molecular interactions to drug efficacy).\n                - **Flat Retrieval**: The search is like dumping all books in a library onto a table and skimming randomly. It ignores the *hierarchy* of knowledge (e.g., quantum mechanics → quantum chemistry → drug interactions).\n\n                **LeanRAG’s fix**:\n                - **Step 1 (Semantic Aggregation)**: Build a *map* of how concepts connect. For example, it clusters entities like *'quantum annealing'* and *'molecular docking'* and draws explicit links between them (e.g., *'quantum annealing optimizes molecular docking simulations'*).\n                - **Step 2 (Hierarchical Retrieval)**: Start with precise, low-level details (e.g., a specific protein’s quantum simulation) and *traverse upward* through the map to gather broader context (e.g., how this fits into drug discovery pipelines).\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of knowledge as a **subway system**:\n                - **Old RAG**: You’re given a list of stations (documents) but no map. You pick stations at random and hope they’re connected.\n                - **LeanRAG**: You get a *complete map* (semantic aggregation) showing all lines (relations) and stations (entities).
