This survey explores how to make them **dynamic**—able to adapt to new challenges, fix their own mistakes, and even *rewrite their own rules* based on feedback.

But these IDs carry no meaning—like a phone number without an area code. The paper proposes **Semantic IDs**: identifiers derived from *embeddings* (vector representations of items) that capture their semantic meaning (e.g., a movie’s genre, plot, or style). These Semantic IDs are then converted into discrete codes (like tokens in a language model) to make them usable in generative models.\n\n                The key question: *How do we create Semantic IDs that work well for **both** search (finding relevant items for a query) **and** recommendation (suggesting items to a user) simultaneously?*\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of Semantic IDs like **DNA barcodes for items**:\n                - Traditional IDs are like random serial numbers (e.g., `A1B2C3`).\n                - Semantic IDs are like genetic sequences that encode traits (e.g., `ATCG-Gene1` for 'sci-fi action movie').\n                A generative model can then *generate* these barcodes to recommend or retrieve items, just like a scientist might predict traits from DNA.\n                \"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components\": {\n                \"problem_space\": {\n                    \"unified_models\": \"\n                    Generative models (e.g., LLMs) are being used to replace separate search and recommendation systems with a *single model*.

This keeps the context intact—like clustering all sentences about 'photosynthesis' in a biology textbook rather than splitting them randomly.\n                - **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a *graph* (nodes = entities like 'chloroplast'; edges = relationships like 'part_of'). This helps the AI 'see' connections between concepts, just like how a human connects dots between related ideas.\n\n                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves irrelevant or fragmented information.

The key challenge is that human-labeled relevance data (e.g., 'this document is relevant to query X') is **expensive to collect**, so researchers often use **cheaper, approximate methods** (e.g., crowdsourcing, pooling, or automated labeling). But if these approximate qrels are flawed, they might lead to **wrong conclusions** about which system is better.\n\n                The paper argues that current evaluation methods focus too much on **Type I errors** (false positives: saying a system is better when it’s not) but ignore **Type II errors** (false negatives: missing a real improvement). Both errors are dangerous:\n                - **Type I errors** waste resources chasing 'imaginary' improvements.\n                - **Type II errors** stall progress by missing *real* advances.\n\n                The authors propose a new way to measure **discriminative power** (how well qrels can detect true differences between systems) by:\n                1.
