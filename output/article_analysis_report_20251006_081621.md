                "explanation": "
                This paper tackles a fundamental problem in **information retrieval (IR)**: how to find the *most relevant* documents from a large, messy collection when the documents and queries have deep *semantic* (meaning-based) relationships that generic search engines (like Google or traditional keyword-based systems) often miss.

                The key insight is that **existing semantic retrieval systems** (which use tools like knowledge graphs) are limited because:
                - They rely on **generic domain knowledge** (e.g., Wikipedia or open-access data), which may not capture the nuances of specialized fields (e.g., medicine, law, or niche engineering domains).
                - Their knowledge sources can become **outdated** quickly, reducing accuracy.
                - They struggle to model **complex relationships** between concepts in a query and documents (e.g., a query about 'treatment for diabetic neuropathy' might need to connect 'diabetes,' 'neuropathy,' 'pharmacological interventions,' and 'clinical trials' in a precise way).

                The authors propose a **new algorithm** called **Semantic-based Concept Retrieval using Group Steiner Tree (GST)**. This algorithm:
                - **Enriches semantic retrieval** by incorporating **domain-specific knowledge** (e.g., medical ontologies for healthcare queries).
                - Uses a **Group Steiner Tree** (a graph theory concept) to optimally connect query terms to document concepts, ensuring the retrieved documents are *semantically coherent* with the query.
                - Is implemented in a system called **SemDR**, which is tested on **170 real-world queries** and achieves **90% precision** and **82% accuracy**—significantly better than baseline systems.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine you’re in a library with books scattered randomly. A traditional search engine is like a librarian who only looks at the *titles* of books to find matches for your question. A semantic retrieval system is like a librarian who reads the *table of contents* and *index* to understand the book’s topics. But the **SemDR system** is like a librarian who:
                1. Knows the *entire subject area* (e.g., biology) deeply (domain knowledge).
                2. Can see *hidden connections* between books (e.g., Book A on 'cell signaling' is relevant to your query on 'cancer treatments' because of a shared pathway).
                3. Uses a *map* (Group Steiner Tree) to find the *shortest path* connecting your query to the most relevant books, even if they don’t share obvious keywords.

                        1. **Knowledge Enrichment**: Integrates domain-specific ontologies (e.g., MeSH for medicine) into the retrieval process.
                        2. **Graph Representation**: Models the query and documents as a **graph**, where:
                           - Nodes = concepts (e.g., 'diabetes,' 'neuropathy').
                           - Edges = semantic relationships (e.g., 'diabetes *causes* neuropathy').
                        3. **Group Steiner Tree**: Finds the *minimum-cost tree* that connects all query concepts to document concepts, ensuring the retrieved documents cover the query’s semantic intent *holistically*.

                The paper doesn’t explicitly address ambiguity resolution, but the **domain knowledge enrichment** likely helps.

This survey explores a new kind of agent—**self-evolving AI agents**—that can *automatically update their own behavior* based on feedback from their environment, kind of like how humans learn from experience.

                    "description": "The paper addresses a critical challenge in **patent law and innovation**: efficiently finding *prior art* (existing patents/documents that describe similar inventions) to determine whether a new patent is novel or if an existing one is valid. This is hard because:
                    - **Scale**: Millions of patents exist, making manual search impractical.
                    - **Nuance**: Patents use complex technical language and require understanding *relationships* between components (not just keywords).
                    - **Domain expertise**: Patent examiners rely on years of training to spot subtle similarities.",
                    "analogy": "Imagine trying to find a single Lego instruction manual in a warehouse of 10 million manuals, where the 'relevant' manual might describe a slightly different but functionally similar design.

                    "description": "The authors propose a **Graph Transformer** model that:
                    1. **Represents patents as graphs**: Each invention is converted into a graph where *nodes* are features/technical elements (e.g., 'battery', 'circuit') and *edges* are relationships (e.g., 'connected to', 'controls').
                    2. **Leverages examiner citations**: The model trains on *real-world relevance signals*—patent examiners’ citations of prior art—to learn what ‘similarity’ means in patent law.
                    3. **Dense retrieval**: Instead of keyword matching, the model embeds entire patent graphs into a vector space where similar inventions are close together.",
                    "why_graphs": "Graphs capture the *structure* of inventions (e.g., how a gear connects to a motor), which text alone misses. For example, two patents might use different words but describe the same mechanical relationship—graphs expose this."

                This paper tackles a modern challenge in AI systems: **how to design a single, unified model that can handle both *search* (finding relevant items based on a query, like Google) and *recommendation* (suggesting items a user might like, like Netflix or Amazon) using generative AI (e.g., LLMs)**. The key innovation is replacing traditional numeric IDs (e.g., `item_12345`) with **Semantic IDs**—machine-readable codes that *encode meaningful information* about the item (e.g., its content, user preferences, or context).

                The problem: If you train separate embeddings (vector representations) for search and recommendation, they might not work well together in a *joint model*. The paper explores how to create Semantic IDs that work for *both tasks simultaneously*, avoiding the need for two separate systems.

                - Semantic IDs are like genetic codes that describe the item’s *traits* (e.g., `movie:action|director:tarantino|rating:R`). A single code can help a model *generate* both search results (*‘Show me Tarantino movies’*) and recommendations (*‘You liked *Pulp Fiction*, so here’s *Kill Bill’**).

The trick is how we label items. Normally, items have random IDs like ‘#123’, but the authors propose ‘Semantic IDs’—codes that describe what the item *is* (e.g., ‘action-movie-1990s’).

        The problem is, if you create these codes separately for search and recommendations, the model gets confused. So they tried making *one shared codebook* by training a model on both tasks. It worked! The model could generate good search results *and* recommendations using the same labels. It’s like giving every movie a DNA sequence that tells you both what it’s about *and* who might like it.’*

        - Fewer models to maintain (cheaper, simpler).

                - **Step 1 (Semantic Aggregation)**: Groups related entities into clusters and builds explicit links between them, turning 'islands' into a connected 'network'.
                - **Step 2 (Hierarchical Retrieval)**: Starts with precise, fine-grained entities (like book paragraphs) and *traverses upward* through the graph’s structure to gather only the most relevant, non-redundant information.
                - **Result**: Faster, more accurate answers with 46% less redundant data retrieved.

The AI is trained using a system of rewards (like a video game where it earns points for doing things right) to ensure it splits questions accurately and doesn’t make mistakes. Tests show it’s about 3% better on average than older methods and can answer some types of questions 13% better while using 30% fewer computational resources.

                **Galileo** is a new AI model designed to understand *many types of remote sensing data* (like satellite images, radar, elevation maps, weather data, etc.) *all at once*. Unlike older models that focus on just one type of data (e.g., only optical images), Galileo can combine *diverse inputs* to solve tasks like tracking crops, detecting floods, or monitoring glaciers.

                The key challenge it solves:
                - Remote sensing objects vary *hugely in size* (e.g., a tiny boat vs. a massive glacier).
                - Data comes in *many forms* (optical, radar, time-series, etc.), and most models can’t handle this diversity.
                - Existing models are *specialists* (good at one task), but Galileo is a *generalist* (good at many tasks).

                **SemRAG is a smarter way to help AI answer questions accurately by combining two key ideas:**
                - **Semantic Chunking**: Instead of splitting documents into arbitrary chunks (e.g., fixed-length paragraphs), SemRAG uses *sentence embeddings* (mathematical representations of meaning) to group related sentences together. This keeps the context intact, like clustering all sentences about 'photosynthesis' in a biology textbook rather than splitting them randomly.
                - **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a *graph* (nodes = entities like 'chlorophyll'; edges = relationships like 'used in photosynthesis'). This helps the AI 'see' connections between concepts, just like a human would link ideas in their mind.

                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves irrelevant or fragmented information. SemRAG fixes this by ensuring the AI gets *coherent, connected* knowledge—like giving it a well-organized textbook instead of scattered notes.

                - **Traditional RAG**: You’re given random pages from different books, some unrelated. You might miss key connections (e.g., how 'mitochondria' relate to 'cellular respiration').
                - **SemRAG**:
                  1. *Semantic Chunking*: Your notes are pre-grouped by topic (all 'cell biology' pages together).
                  2. *Knowledge Graph*: You also get a mind map showing how 'mitochondria' → 'ATP' → 'energy' connect.
                This makes answering questions (e.g., 'How do cells produce energy?') far easier and more accurate.

                    - **Step 2**: Convert each sentence into a *vector* (embedding) using models like BERT or Sentence-BERT. These vectors capture semantic meaning (e.g., 'Rising CO2 levels cause global warming' and 'Greenhouse gases trap heat' will have similar vectors).
                    - **Step 3**: Group sentences with high *cosine similarity* (a measure of vector closeness). For example, all sentences about 'causes of climate change' form one chunk, while 'effects on biodiversity' form another.
                    - **Output**: Chunks that are *topically coherent*, not just arbitrarily split.

                    - **Step 3**: During question-answering, the AI traverses this graph to find *connected* information. For example, for 'How does CO2 impact glaciers?', it follows:

                **Imagine you're teaching a one-way street driver (a decoder-only LLM like GPT) to understand traffic patterns in both directions without rebuilding the entire road system.**
                Causal2Vec is a clever hack that gives these 'one-way' language models (which normally only look at past words) the ability to create high-quality text embeddings (vector representations of meaning) *without*:
                - Changing their core architecture (no surgery on the model)
                - Adding heavy computational overhead (no traffic jams)
                - Losing the knowledge they gained during pretraining (no amnesia).

                **Key trick**: It pre-processes the input text with a tiny BERT-style model to create a single 'contextual token' (like a traffic report summary) that gets *prepended* to the original text. This lets every word in the sequence 'see' some bidirectional context indirectly, even though the main model still processes text left-to-right.

        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_idea": "ARES is a tool designed to automatically evaluate **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems—the AI models that combine search (retrieval) with text generation (e.g., chatbots that cite sources). Traditional evaluation methods rely on human judgment or limited metrics, which are slow, expensive, or incomplete. ARES automates this by simulating how a human would assess RAG outputs across **4 key dimensions**:
                1. **Answer Correctness** (Is the generated answer factually accurate?),
                2. **Contextual Precision** (Does the retrieved context actually support the answer?),
                3. **Contextual Recall** (Does the answer cover all relevant information from the context?),
                4. **Faithfulness** (Does the answer stay true to the context without hallucinations?).",

                "analogy": "Imagine a student writing an essay with Wikipedia as their only source. ARES acts like a teacher who:
                - Checks if the essay’s claims match Wikipedia (**correctness**),
                - Verifies the student didn’t ignore key Wikipedia sections (**recall**),
                - Ensures the student didn’t cite unrelated Wikipedia pages (**precision**),
                - Confirms the student didn’t make up facts (**faithfulness**).
                ARES does this *automatically* for AI systems at scale."

                "modular_design": {
                    "description": "ARES breaks evaluation into independent modules, each targeting one of the 4 dimensions. This allows:
                    - **Customization**: Users can focus on specific aspects (e.g., only correctness for a fact-checking app).
                    - **Scalability**: New metrics can be added without redesigning the entire framework.
                    - **Interpretability**: Failures can be traced to specific modules (e.g., 'The answer was wrong because the context retrieval failed').",
                    "example": "A medical RAG system might prioritize **faithfulness** (no hallucinated symptoms) over **recall** (missing rare side effects), so ARES can weight modules accordingly."

                    "description": "ARES replaces human judgment with:
                    - **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Uses large language models (like GPT-4) to score answers by comparing them to retrieved contexts and ground truth.
                    - **Reference-Free Evaluation**: Doesn’t require pre-written 'correct answers'—it dynamically checks consistency between context and generation.
                    - **Multi-Turn Dialogue Support**: Evaluates conversational RAG systems (e.g., chatbots) by tracking context across multiple user queries.",
                    "tradeoffs": "While faster than humans, LLM judges may inherit biases or miss nuanced errors. ARES mitigates this by:
                    - **Ensemble Scoring**: Combining multiple LLM judges for robustness.
                    - **Rule-Based Checks**: Adding deterministic rules (e.g., 'If the answer cites a source not in the context, penalize precision')."

                    - **Adversarial Tests**: 'Tricky' queries designed to expose RAG weaknesses (e.g., ambiguous questions, conflicting sources).
                    - **Leaderboards**: Standardized scoring to compare RAG systems (e.g., 'System A scores 89% on correctness vs. System B’s 72%').",

                    - **Narrow**: Metrics like BLEU or ROUGE (used for translation/summarization) don’t capture RAG-specific issues (e.g., wrong citations).",

                "core_idea": "This paper solves a key problem: **How to efficiently turn large language models (LLMs) into high-quality text embedding generators without full fine-tuning?** The authors combine three techniques:
                1. **Smart pooling** of token embeddings (how to squash a sentence's word vectors into one vector)
                2. **Prompt engineering** (designing input text to guide the LLM's focus)
                3. **Lightweight contrastive fine-tuning** (teaching the model to distinguish similar vs. dissimilar texts using synthetic examples)
                The result is a system that matches specialized embedding models while using far fewer computational resources.",

                "analogy": "Imagine you have a super-smart chef (the LLM) who normally makes elaborate dishes (text generation). You want them to instead create perfect *sauce reductions* (text embeddings) that capture all the flavors (semantics) of the original ingredients (tokens). The paper shows how to:
                - Pick the right strainer (pooling method) to separate liquid from solids
                - Give the chef clear instructions (prompts) like 'Make this sauce work for Italian dishes' (clustering tasks)
                - Let them taste-test pairs of sauces (contrastive learning) to refine their technique—without retraining them from scratch."

                    - Lose information (naive averaging of token embeddings)
                    - Require massive compute (full fine-tuning)
                    - Use separate, smaller models (like Sentence-BERT) that lack LLM's semantic richness",

                    "benchmark_target": "The **Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)**—specifically the English clustering track—serves as the proving ground. Clustering is a harsh test because embeddings must preserve *both* semantic similarity *and* discriminative differences."

                        - **Max pooling**: Take the highest activation per dimension
                        - **CLS token**: Use the special [CLS] token's embedding (common in BERT-style models)

    "analysis": {
        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_question": "The paper asks: *Can we trust conclusions drawn from data labeled by LLMs (Large Language Models) when the LLMs themselves are uncertain about their annotations?* It’s like asking whether a student’s shaky guesses on a test can still lead to a correct final grade if you analyze them the right way.",

                "analogy": "Imagine a team of interns labeling political speeches as 'populist' or 'not populist,' but they’re often unsure. The paper explores whether their *patterns of uncertainty* (e.g., 'I’m 60% sure this is populist') can still reveal meaningful trends—even if individual labels are unreliable. The key is aggregating their 'confusion' statistically to find hidden signals.",

                "key_terms_simplified":
                - **"Unconfident annotations"**: When an LLM assigns a label (e.g., 'populist') but with low confidence (e.g., 55% probability).
                - **"Confident conclusions"**: Reliable insights (e.g., 'populism increased by 20% in 2020') derived *despite* noisy labels.
                - **"Political science case study"**: Testing this on real-world data (Dutch parliamentary speeches) to see if LLM uncertainty correlates with human expert judgments.
            },

            "2_identify_gaps": {
                "assumptions":
                - "LLM confidence scores (e.g., 0.6 probability) are meaningful proxies for 'true' uncertainty." *(But are they? LLMs don’t 'know' uncertainty like humans do.)*
                - "Aggregating uncertain labels can cancel out noise." *(Only if the noise is random—not if LLMs have systematic biases.)*
                - "Human experts are the 'ground truth.'" *(But experts disagree too! What if the 'truth' is subjective?)*,

                "unanswered_questions":
                - "How do you distinguish between *useful* uncertainty (e.g., 'this speech is ambiguous') and *harmful* uncertainty (e.g., 'the LLM is bad at this task')?"
                - "Does this method work for tasks beyond political science (e.g., medical diagnosis, legal analysis)?"
                - "What if the LLM’s confidence is *miscalibrated* (e.g., it says 90% sure but is wrong half the time)?"
            },

            "3_rebuild_from_scratch": {
                "step_by_step_logic":
                1. **Problem Setup**:
                   - Task: Classify Dutch parliamentary speeches as "populist" or not.
                   - Challenge: Human labeling is expensive; LLMs are cheap but imperfect.
                   - Twist: LLMs often give *probabilities* (e.g., 0.7 for "populist"), not just binary labels.

                2. **Key Insight**:
                   - Instead of discarding low-confidence labels, treat them as *data points* in a probabilistic model.
                   - Example: If an LLM says "60% populist" for 100 speeches, the *distribution* of those scores might reveal trends (e.g., a shift toward higher probabilities over time).

                3. **Method**:
                   - **Aggregation**: Combine LLM probabilities across many examples to estimate overall trends (e.g., "populism increased").
                   - **Validation**: Compare LLM-derived trends to human expert labels to check if they align.
                   - **Uncertainty Quantification**: Use statistical tools (e.g., Bayesian modeling) to measure how much the LLM’s uncertainty affects conclusions.

                4. **Findings**:
                   - In the Dutch speeches case, LLM uncertainty *did* correlate with human judgments of ambiguity.
                   - Trends derived from uncertain labels matched expert-labeled trends, *but only when aggregated carefully*.
                   - **Caveat**: Individual low-confidence labels were often wrong, but their *collective patterns* were informative.

                5. **Generalization**:
                   - This suggests a framework for using "noisy" LLM annotations in other domains, *if*:
                     - The task involves detecting *relative changes* (e.g., trends over time) rather than absolute labels.
                     - The LLM’s uncertainty is somewhat aligned with real-world ambiguity.
            },

            "4_analogy_to_intuition": {
                "real_world_parallel": "Think of a weather forecast that says '40% chance of rain.' A single forecast might be wrong, but if you track *many* 40% forecasts, you’ll find it rains ~40% of the time. Similarly, an LLM’s 60% 'populist' label might be wrong for one speech, but across 1,000 speeches, the *average* 60% probability could reveal a real trend.",

                "why_it_works": "The 'wisdom of crowds' effect—but instead of crowdsourcing humans, you’re crowdsourcing *probabilistic guesses* from an LLM. The noise averages out if the biases are random.",

                "limits_of_the_analogy": "Unlike weather, LLM 'uncertainty' isn’t grounded in physical laws. If the LLM is systematically bad at judging populism (e.g., it overestimates confidence for sarcastic speeches), the method fails."

                - "Always validate trends against human-labeled data before trusting them."
                - "Use tools like Bayesian hierarchical models to account for LLM uncertainty explicitly.",

                "for_practitioners":
                - "If you’re using LLMs to label data (e.g., for content moderation, market research), track confidence scores—they might reveal hidden patterns."
                - "Avoid using raw LLM labels for high-stakes decisions; focus on *trends* or *relative comparisons* instead.",

                "ethical_considerations":
                - "Bias amplification": If LLMs are uncertain about marginalized groups’ speech, aggregating their labels might reinforce stereotypes.
                - "Transparency": Users of LLM-labeled datasets should disclose how uncertainty was handled."

                "potential_flaws":
                - **"Garbage in, garbage out"**: If the LLM’s uncertainty is arbitrary (e.g., not tied to real ambiguity), aggregation won’t help.
                - **"Overfitting to noise"**: Complex statistical models might mistake LLM quirks for real trends.
                - **"Domain dependence"**: Works for populism (where ambiguity is inherent) but may fail for factual tasks (e.g., 'Is this molecule toxic?').",

                "alternative_approaches":
                - "Active learning": Have humans label only the cases where LLMs are most uncertain.
                - "Ensemble methods": Combine multiple LLMs’ probabilities to reduce noise.
                - "Calibration": Adjust LLM confidence scores to match real accuracy (e.g., if it says 70% but is right only 50% of the time)."
            }
        },

        "summary_for_a_12_year_old": {
            "explanation": "Scientists wanted to know: If a robot (like a super-smart AI) isn’t sure whether a politician’s speech is 'populist' (like saying 'the people vs. the elite'), can we still use its guesses to learn something? Turns out, yes—but only if we look at *lots* of guesses together. It’s like if your friends aren’t sure what’s for lunch, but if most of them *think* it’s pizza, it probably is! The robot’s unsure answers aren’t useless; they’re clues that add up to a bigger picture.",

            "why_it_matters": "This could save time and money! Instead of paying experts to label everything, we might use AI’s 'maybe' answers to spot trends—like if populism is rising—without needing perfect data."

    "extracted_title": **"Can Unconfident LLM Annotations Be Used for Confident Conclusions?"** *(as explicitly cited in the post content and linked to arXiv paper [2408.15204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15204))*,

    "analysis": {
        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_question": "The paper asks: *Can we reliably extract high-confidence conclusions from low-confidence annotations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)?* This challenges the assumption that LLM outputs must be 'certain' to be useful. The key insight is that *aggregation* or *post-processing* of uncertain annotations might yield robust results—similar to how noisy data in statistics can still reveal patterns when analyzed collectively.",

                "analogy": "Imagine a room of 100 people guessing the weight of an elephant. Individually, their guesses are wildly off (low confidence), but if you average them, you might get surprisingly close to the true weight (high-confidence conclusion). The paper explores whether LLMs can work similarly: their 'uncertain' annotations, when combined strategically, might produce reliable insights.",

                "why_it_matters": "This matters because:
                - **Cost**: High-confidence LLM outputs often require expensive fine-tuning or human review.
                - **Scalability**: Low-confidence annotations are easier to generate at scale.
                - **Bias mitigation**: Aggregating diverse, uncertain outputs might reduce individual biases."
            },

            "2_key_concepts_deconstructed": {
                "unconfident_annotations": {
                    "definition": "LLM outputs where the model expresses low certainty (e.g., low probability scores, hedged language like 'might be' or 'possibly'). These are typically discarded in favor of high-confidence outputs.",
                    "examples": [
                        "An LLM labeling a tweet as *70% likely to be misinformation* (vs. 95% certainty).",
                        "A model generating multiple plausible translations for a sentence, none with >80% confidence."
                    ],
                    "challenge": "How to distinguish between 'useful uncertainty' (e.g., genuine ambiguity in data) and 'harmful noise' (e.g., model hallucinations)?"
                },

                "confident_conclusions": {
                    "definition": "High-certainty insights derived *indirectly* from low-confidence annotations, via methods like:
                    - **Ensemble voting**: Combining annotations from multiple LLMs/models.
                    - **Probabilistic calibration**: Adjusting confidence scores to reflect true accuracy.
                    - **Consistency filtering**: Keeping only annotations where multiple low-confidence outputs agree.",
                    "theoretical_basis": "Draws from:
                    - *Wisdom of the Crowd* (Galton, 1907): Aggregating independent estimates reduces error.
                    - *Weak Supervision* (e.g., Snorkel): Noisy labels can train robust models if dependencies are modeled."

                    "from_arxiv_abstract_style": "(Note: Since the full paper isn’t provided, these are inferred from the title and typical LLM annotation research:)"
                    - **"Confidence reweighting"**: Assign higher weight to annotations where the LLM’s uncertainty correlates with human uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous cases).
                    - **"Diversity sampling"**: Prioritize annotations from LLMs with diverse architectures/training data to reduce correlated errors.
                    - **"Iterative refinement"**: Use low-confidence annotations as *weak signals* to guide human-in-the-loop validation."

                        - The input is ambiguous (*epistemic uncertainty*), or
                        - The model is poorly trained (*aleatoric uncertainty*).
                        The paper likely addresses this, but the post doesn’t clarify."

                "step_by_step_logic": [
                    1. **"Problem Setup"**:
                       - Start with a dataset where LLMs provide annotations with confidence scores (e.g., "This image contains a cat: 40% confidence").
                       - Discard high-confidence annotations (e.g., >90%) to simulate a "low-confidence-only" scenario.

                    2. **"Aggregation Strategy"**:
                       - For each data point, collect *N* low-confidence annotations from diverse LLMs/models.
                       - Apply a combining rule (e.g., majority vote, weighted average by confidence, or probabilistic modeling).

                    3. **"Evaluation"**:
                       - Compare the aggregated conclusions to ground truth (or high-confidence baselines).
                       - Metrics might include:
                         - *Accuracy*: Do aggregated conclusions match human labels?
                         - *Calibration*: Do the aggregated confidence scores reflect true error rates?
                         - *Coverage*: What % of data points yield "confident conclusions" after aggregation?

                    4. **"Theoretical Justification"**:
                       - Prove (empirically or mathematically) that under certain conditions (e.g., independent errors, sufficient diversity), aggregation reduces variance in conclusions.
                       - Likely cites work on *noisy labeling* (e.g., [Awasthi et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08192)) or *Bayesian aggregation*."
