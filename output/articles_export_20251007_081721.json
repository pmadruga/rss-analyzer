Think of it like a video game character that starts weak but gets smarter and more skilled the more you play, except here, the 'character' is an AI system working in the real world (e.g., managing finances, diagnosing diseases, or writing code).\n\n                The problem today is that most AI agents are **static**: they’re trained once and then deployed, unable to change even if the world around them does. This survey explores how to build agents that *evolve*—using feedback from their environment to automatically tweak their own design, goals, or behaviors. It’s a bridge between two big ideas:\n                - **Foundation Models** (like ChatGPT): Powerful but general-purpose AI that doesn’t specialize.\n                - **Lifelong Learning**: Systems that keep improving, like humans do.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a **self-driving car**:\n                - *Static AI*: The car is programmed with fixed rules (e.g., 'stop at red lights').

This could involve:\n                   - Tweaking the agent’s *architecture* (e.g., adding new skills).\n                   - Adjusting its *goals* (e.g., prioritizing speed over accuracy in emergencies).\n                   - Refining its *knowledge* (e.g., updating outdated medical guidelines).\n\n                **Why this matters**: Without this loop, agents are like a thermostat—good at one fixed task.

Answering those parts at the same time.\n        Over time, it learns to do this automatically.\n\n        **What’s the payoff?**\n        - **Faster answers**: Up to 30% fewer steps for complex questions.\n        - **Better accuracy**: Fewer mistakes from sequential dependencies.\n        - **Saves resources**: Uses less computing power for the same (or better) results.\n\n        **Real-world example**:\n        Imagine asking, 'Which is heavier: a blue whale, an elephant, or a giraffe?' Instead of weighing them one by one, the AI can look up all three weights at once and compare them instantly.\n        \"\n    }\n}\n```",

Hallucinations are false or misleading statements generated by LLMs that conflict with real-world knowledge or input context. The challenge is that detecting these errors manually is slow and expensive, so the authors built an **automated framework** with two key parts:\n                - **10,923 prompts** across 9 domains (e.g., coding, science, summarization).\n                - **Automatic verifiers** that break LLM outputs into small 'atomic facts' and check them against trusted knowledge sources (e.g., databases, scientific literature).\n\n                They tested **14 LLMs** (including state-of-the-art models) and found that even the best ones hallucinate **up to 86% of the time** in some domains. The paper also proposes a **new taxonomy** for hallucinations:\n                - **Type A**: Errors from *misremembering* training data (e.g., wrong dates, names).\n                - **Type B**: Errors from *inherently incorrect* training data (e.g., outdated facts).\n                - **Type C**: Complete *fabrications* (e.g., citing fake studies).\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a student writing an essay:\n                - **Type A** is like mixing up two historical events (e.g., saying the Moon landing was in 1970 instead of 1969).\n                - **Type B** is like repeating a myth they learned (e.g., 'bats are blind') because their textbook was wrong.\n                - **Type C** is like inventing a quote from Shakespeare that doesn’t exist.\n                HALoGEN is like a teacher’s answer key that automatically flags each type of mistake.\n                \"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components_deep_dive\": {\n                \"benchmark_design\": {\n                    \"domains_covered\": \"\n                    The 9 domains were chosen to represent diverse LLM use cases where hallucinations have high stakes:\n                    1. **Programming** (e.g., generating code with incorrect logic).\n                    2. **Scientific attribution** (e.g., citing fake papers).\n                    3. **Summarization** (e.g., adding false details to a news summary).\n                    4. **Medical advice** (e.g., recommending harmful treatments).\n                    5. **Legal reasoning** (e.g., misquoting laws).\n                    6. **Mathematical reasoning** (e.g., incorrect proofs).\n                    7. **Commonsense QA** (e.g., 'The Eiffel Tower is in London').\n                    8. **Entity linking** (e.g., confusing two similar people).\n                    9. **Temporal reasoning** (e.g., wrong historical timelines).\n                    \",\n                    \"why_these_domains\": \"\n                    These domains were selected because:\n                    - They require **precision** (e.g., code must run; medical advice must be safe).\n                    - They often rely on **external knowledge** (e.g., laws, scientific facts).\n                    - Hallucinations here can have **real-world harm** (e.g., legal or health consequences).\n                    \"\n                },\n                \"automatic_verification\": {\n                    \"how_it_works\": \"\n                    The verifiers use a **decomposition → validation** pipeline:\n                    1. **Decomposition**: Break LLM outputs into 'atomic facts' (e.g., in the sentence *'The capital of France is Paris, which has a population of 2 million.'*, the atomic facts are:\n                       - [Capital of France = Paris] (correct).\n                       - [Population of Paris = 2M] (incorrect; actual ~2.1M in 2023).\n                    2. **Validation**: Each fact is checked against a **high-quality source**:\n                       - For programming: Execute the code to see if it works.\n                       - For science: Cross-reference with databases like PubMed or arXiv.\n                       - For temporals: Check against timelines (e.g., Wikidata).\n                    \",\n                    \"precision_vs_recall\": \"\n                    The verifiers prioritize **high precision** (few false positives) over recall (catching all errors).
