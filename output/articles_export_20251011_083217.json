Manual evaluation is slow and inconsistent, while existing automated metrics (like BLEU or ROUGE) don’t capture RAG-specific failures (e.g., wrong retrievals or hallucinations).*\n                ARES fixes this by simulating **realistic user queries**, checking if the system retrieves the *right* information, and then verifying if the LLM’s answer is *faithful* to that information—all without human intervention.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a librarian (retriever) who fetches books for a student (LLM) writing an essay.
