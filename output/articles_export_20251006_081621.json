This keeps the context intact, like clustering all sentences about 'photosynthesis' in a biology textbook rather than splitting them randomly.\n                - **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a *graph* (nodes = entities like 'chlorophyll'; edges = relationships like 'used in photosynthesis'). This helps the AI 'see' connections between concepts, just like a human would link ideas in their mind.\n\n                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves irrelevant or fragmented information. SemRAG fixes this by ensuring the AI gets *coherent, connected* knowledge—like giving it a well-organized textbook instead of scattered notes.\n               \",\n\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re studying for an exam:\n                - **Traditional RAG**: You’re given random pages from different books, some unrelated.

These vectors capture semantic meaning (e.g., 'Rising CO2 levels cause global warming' and 'Greenhouse gases trap heat' will have similar vectors).\n                    - **Step 3**: Group sentences with high *cosine similarity* (a measure of vector closeness). For example, all sentences about 'causes of climate change' form one chunk, while 'effects on biodiversity' form another.\n                    - **Output**: Chunks that are *topically coherent*, not just arbitrarily split.\n                    \",\n                    \"why_it_helps\": \"\n                    - **Reduces noise**: Avoids retrieving unrelated sentences (e.g., a chunk about 'polar bears' won’t include a random sentence about 'solar panels').\n                    - **Preserves context**: The AI gets *complete thoughts*, not fragments. For example, a question about 'how climate change affects oceans' retrieves a chunk with *all* relevant ocean-related sentences.\n                    \"\n                },\n\n                \"knowledge_graph_integration\": {\n                    \"how_it_works\": \"\n                    - **Input**: Retrieved chunks from semantic chunking.\n                    - **Step 1**: Extract *entities* (e.g., 'CO2', 'glaciers', 'sea level rise') and *relationships* (e.g., 'CO2 → causes → warming').\n                    - **Step 2**: Build a graph where:\n                      - **Nodes** = entities (e.g., 'CO2', 'temperature').\n                      - **Edges** = relationships (e.g., 'increases', 'affects').\n                    - **Step 3**: During question-answering, the AI traverses this graph to find *connected* information. For example, for 'How does CO2 impact glaciers?', it follows:\n                      `CO2 → increases temperature → melts glaciers → raises sea levels`.\n                    \",\n                    \"why_it_helps\": \"\n                    - **Multi-hop reasoning**: Answers complex questions requiring *chains of logic* (e.g., 'Why are coastal cities flooding more?').
