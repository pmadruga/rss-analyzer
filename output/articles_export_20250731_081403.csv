HALoGEN: Fantastic LLM Hallucinations and Where to Find Them,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292,2025-07-31T00:00:35+00:00,2025-07-31 08:08:03,"Imagine you have a friend who tells amazing stories, but sometimes they mix up facts or make things up. This is similar to what large language models (LLMs) do—they generate impressive text but sometimes produce 'hallucinations,' which are statements that don't align with reality or the given context. Our goal was to measure and understand these hallucinations.

Here's how we approached it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Problem**: We started by recognizing that measuring hallucinations is t...","Our main discoveries were eye-opening:

1. **Prevalence of Hallucinations**: Even the best language models produced a lot of hallucinations. In some areas, up to 86% of the generated facts were incorrect. This is like finding out your storytelling friend often gets details wrong, no matter how good they are at telling stories.

1. **Prompt Creation**: We gathered prompts from various domains to ensure our benchmark was diverse. This is like giving your storytelling friend a wide range of topics to talk about.

2. **Decomposition into Atomic Units**: We broke down the generated texts into small, simple facts. Think of it as taking a complex sentence and breaking it into individual statements that can be easily checked.

3. **Verification Against Know...","Designing our study involved careful planning:

1. **Diverse Prompts**: We chose prompts from nine different domains to ensure our findings were broadly applicable. This is like testing your friend's storytelling across many topics to see if they mix up facts in all areas or just some.

Language Model Re-rankers are Fooled by Lexical Similarities,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17036,2025-07-29T22:40:29+00:00,2025-07-31 08:08:53,"Imagine you're trying to find the best answers to questions from a large pile of documents. Traditionally, people use a method called BM25, which is like a simple filter that looks for documents containing the same words as the question. More recently, language model (LM) re-rankers have been introduced. These are like smart assistants that not only look for matching words but also try to understand the meaning and context of the question and the documents. They're more sophisticated but also...","Our main discoveries were both surprising and insightful:

1. **LM Re-rankers Struggle**: We found that LM re-rankers didn't always outperform the simple BM25 method, especially on the DRUID dataset. This was surprising because LM re-rankers are supposed to be more advanced.

2. **Lexical Dissimilarities**: We identified that LM re-rankers often made mistakes when the documents didn't have many words in common with the query. This means they were sometimes fooled by the lack of lexical simila...","To understand our technical approach, let's break it down into simple components:
