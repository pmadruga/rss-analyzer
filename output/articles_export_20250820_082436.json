This survey explores a new direction—**self-evolving agents**—that can *automatically* refine their behavior based on feedback from their environment, users, or their own performance.\n\n                The key insight is combining two big ideas:\n                - **Foundation Models** (like LLMs): Pre-trained AI systems with broad capabilities (e.g., language understanding, reasoning).\n                - **Lifelong Learning**: The ability to keep improving *after deployment*, like how humans learn from experience.\n\n                The paper organizes this field by proposing a **unified framework** (a 'feedback loop') to understand how self-evolving agents work, then surveys existing techniques, challenges, and applications.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine a **self-driving car** that starts with basic driving skills (foundation model).

The paper proposes **Semantic IDs**: meaningful, discrete codes derived from embeddings (vector representations of items) that capture their semantic properties (e.g., a movie’s genre, theme, or style). The goal is to create IDs that help a *single generative model* excel at **both**:\n                - **Search** (finding relevant items for a query, e.g., \\\"best sci-fi movies\\\"),\n                - **Recommendation** (suggesting items to a user based on their history, e.g., \\\"because you watched *Inception*\\\").\",\n\n                \"why_it_matters\": \"\n                - **Unification**: Instead of building separate models for search and recommendation (which is expensive and inconsistent), the paper aims for a *single generative model* that handles both tasks.\n                - **Generalization**: Traditional embeddings are often task-specific (e.g., optimized only for search or only for recommendations). The paper asks: *Can we design embeddings that work well for both?*\n                - **Semantic grounding**: Semantic IDs are interpretable (unlike random IDs) and can improve performance by leveraging the *meaning* of items, not just their surface features.\"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components\": {\n                \"problem_space\": {\n                    \"challenge\": \"\n                    - **Task conflict**: Embeddings optimized for search (e.g., matching queries to documents) may not capture user preferences well, and vice versa.\n                    - **ID design**: How to structure Semantic IDs?
