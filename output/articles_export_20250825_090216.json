This survey explores a new wave of **self-evolving agents** that can *learn from their experiences*, adjust their behavior, and even redesign parts of themselves to handle dynamic, real-world environments.\n\n                Think of it like the difference between:\n                - A **thermostat** (static: follows fixed rules to turn heat on/off).\n                - A **self-driving car** (evolving: learns from new roads, weather, and traffic patterns over time).\",\n\n                \"why_it_matters\": \"Current AI (like LLMs) is powerful but *frozen* after training.

This ensures related ideas stay together, like clustering all sentences about 'photosynthesis' in a biology text.\n                - **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a graph showing *relationships* between entities (e.g., 'Einstein' → 'developed' → 'Theory of Relativity'). This helps the AI understand context better than just reading raw text.\n\n                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) often retrieves irrelevant or disjointed chunks, leading to 'hallucinations' or wrong answers. SemRAG fixes this by:\n                1. **Preserving meaning** in chunks (no broken context).\n                2. **Linking facts** via graphs (e.g., connecting symptoms to diseases in medical QA).\n                3. **Avoiding fine-tuning**: No need to retrain the entire LLM—just improve how it *retrieves* and *structures* data.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine you’re studying for an exam:\n                - **Traditional RAG**: You highlight random sentences from a textbook and hope they’re useful.

Traditional GraphRAG uses LLMs to extract entities/relations from text, but this is slow and costly. The authors propose a **dependency-based KG construction** (using NLP tools instead of LLMs) and a **lightweight graph retrieval** method to make GraphRAG practical for real-world applications like SAP’s legacy code migration.\",\n\n                \"analogy\": \"Imagine you’re building a **library card catalog** (the KG) for a huge collection of handwritten notes (unstructured text). Instead of hiring an expensive expert (LLM) to read every note and create catalog entries, you use a **rule-based system** (NLP libraries) to automatically extract key terms and links between them. Then, when someone asks a question, you don’t search the entire library—you quickly grab the most relevant cards (one-hop traversal) and a few connected ones (subgraph extraction) to answer efficiently.\"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components\": {\n                \"problem\": {\n                    \"description\": \"GraphRAG is powerful for multi-hop reasoning (e.g., answering questions requiring chained facts) but faces two bottlenecks:\n                    1. **KG Construction Cost**: LLMs are used to extract entities/relations from text, which is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets.\n                    2. **Retrieval Latency**: Traversing large graphs to find relevant subgraphs for a query is time-consuming, especially in enterprise settings with strict performance requirements.\",\n                    \"example\": \"For SAP’s legacy code migration, you might need to link functions, variables, and dependencies across millions of lines of code.
