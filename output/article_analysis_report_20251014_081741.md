                This paper tackles a fundamental problem in **document retrieval systems**: how to find *truly relevant* documents when:
                - The data comes from diverse sources (e.g., scientific papers, legal texts, medical records) with different structures and vocabularies.
                - The system needs to understand not just keywords but the *semantic relationships* between concepts (e.g., 'diabetes' is related to 'insulin resistance' in medicine, but not in a culinary context).
                - Generic knowledge graphs (like Wikipedia-based ones) often miss **domain-specific nuances** or rely on outdated information.

                The authors propose a **two-part solution**:
                1. A new algorithm called **Semantic-based Concept Retrieval using Group Steiner Tree (GST)** that weaves in domain-specific knowledge to improve how the system 'understands' relationships between concepts.
                2. A real-world implementation (the **SemDR system**) tested on 170 search queries, showing **90% precision** and **82% accuracy**—significantly better than existing baselines.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine you’re a librarian helping a biologist find papers on 'CRISPR gene editing.' A keyword search might return papers on 'CRISPR' (the bacterial immune system) *and* 'gene editing,' but miss the critical link between them. A generic knowledge graph might connect 'CRISPR' to 'bacteria,' but not to 'Cas9' (the enzyme used in editing). This paper’s approach is like giving the librarian a **biology textbook** (domain knowledge) and a **family tree of concepts** (GST algorithm) to trace how 'CRISPR' → 'Cas9' → 'gene editing' are interconnected in *this specific field*.

                        - **Group Steiner Tree (GST)**: An optimization algorithm that finds the 'cheapest' way to connect a set of nodes (concepts) in a graph. Here, it’s repurposed to link query terms to relevant documents via *semantic paths* in a domain-enriched knowledge graph.
                        - **Domain Knowledge Enrichment**: The KG is augmented with domain-specific ontologies (e.g., MeSH for medicine, ACM Computing Classification for CS) to add missing edges (e.g., 'transformer models' → 'attention mechanisms' in NLP).
                        - **Semantic Scoring**: Documents are ranked based on:
                          1. **Concept proximity**: How closely their terms align with the query’s semantic neighborhood in the KG.
                          2. **Domain relevance**: Weighting paths that use domain-specific edges higher than generic ones.
                        ",
                        "why_GST": "
                        GST is ideal because it:
                        - Handles **multiple query terms** simultaneously (unlike shortest-path methods).
                        - Optimizes for *cohesive subgraphs* (e.g., a document covering 'CRISPR' + 'gene editing' + 'Cas9' scores higher than one with just two terms).
                        - Is computationally efficient for large KGs (NP-hard but solvable with heuristics).

                This paper is about **AI agents that can *improve themselves over time***—like a robot or software assistant that doesn’t just follow pre-programmed rules but *learns from its experiences* and gets better at its job without human intervention. Think of it like a video game character that starts weak but levels up by fighting monsters (except here, the 'monsters' are real-world tasks like writing code, diagnosing diseases, or managing investments).

                The big problem today is that most AI agents (like chatbots or automated systems) are **static**: they’re trained once and then frozen. This paper argues we need agents that *evolve*—like how humans learn from mistakes. The authors call these **'self-evolving AI agents'** and say they’re the next step toward truly *lifelong* AI systems.

                "analogy": "
                Imagine a chef (the AI agent) who starts with a basic cookbook (a foundation model like GPT-4). Today’s AI chefs can follow recipes but can’t invent new dishes. A *self-evolving* chef would:
                1. Try cooking a meal (interact with the environment).
                2. Get feedback (e.g., customers say the soup is too salty).
                3. Adjust the recipe *automatically* (optimize its own behavior).
                4. Repeat forever, getting better over time.

                This paper is a *survey* (a map of all current research) on how to build such chefs for AI.

                "unified_framework": "
                The authors propose a **4-part framework** to understand how self-evolving agents work. It’s like a loop:

                1. **System Inputs**: The agent’s goals (e.g., 'write a Python script') and external data (e.g., user requests, sensor data).
                2. **Agent System**: The AI’s 'brain'—its models, tools, and memory (e.g., a language model + a code interpreter).
                3. **Environment**: The real world or simulation where the agent acts (e.g., a stock market, a hospital database).
                4. **Optimisers**: The 'learning engine' that tweaks the agent based on feedback (e.g., reinforcement learning, human critiques).

                The loop runs continuously: *Input → Agent acts → Environment reacts → Optimiser improves agent → Repeat*.
                ",
                "evolution_targets": "
                The paper categorizes how agents can evolve by improving different parts of themselves:
                - **Model Evolution**: Upgrading the AI’s core brain (e.g., fine-tuning a language model).
                - **Memory Evolution**: Better storing/recalling past experiences (like a human learning from mistakes).
                - **Tool Evolution**: Adding/improving tools (e.g., an agent that starts with a calculator but later learns to use a CAD program).
                - **Objective Evolution**: Changing what the agent optimizes for (e.g., shifting from 'speed' to 'accuracy' as it learns).

                "examples": "
                The paper highlights that self-evolving agents need *custom designs* for different fields because goals and constraints vary:
                - **Biomedicine**: An agent diagnosing diseases must evolve *safely*—it can’t experiment on real patients! So it might use simulated data or human-in-the-loop checks.
                - **Programming**: An AI coder could evolve by analyzing GitHub repositories, but it needs to avoid generating buggy code that crashes systems.
                - **Finance**: A trading agent must adapt to market shifts but can’t take risky bets that lose money. It might use 'sandbox' testing before real trades.

                This shows that **one-size-fits-all evolution doesn’t work**. A medical agent’s 'feedback loop' can’t be the same as a chatbot’s because the stakes (and data) are totally different.

                - **Dynamic Benchmarks**: Traditional tests (like Q&A accuracy) don’t work for agents that change over time. We need benchmarks that *themselves evolve*.
                - **Long-Term Metrics**: An agent might get worse before it gets better (like a human learning a new skill). How do we judge progress?

                Self-evolving agents could go rogue if not controlled:

                - **Bias Amplification**: If the agent learns from biased data, it could become *more* biased over time.
                - **Accountability**: Who’s responsible if an evolved agent causes harm? The original developers? The users?

                The paper stresses needing **guardrails** like:
                - Human oversight (e.g., approval for major changes).
                - 'Sandbox' testing before real-world deployment.

                Today’s AI is like a **fixed tool** (e.g., a hammer). Self-evolving agents aim to be **living tools** that sharpen themselves. This could lead to:
                - **Personal Assistants**: An AI that starts as a calendar bot but evolves to manage your entire life.
                - **Scientific Discovery**: Agents that design experiments, learn from results, and propose new hypotheses—*without human scientists in the loop*.

                This paper tackles a fundamental challenge in modern AI systems: **how to design item identifiers (IDs) that work seamlessly for *both* search and recommendation tasks** when using generative AI models (like LLMs). Traditionally, systems use arbitrary unique IDs (e.g., `item_12345`), but these lack meaning. The authors propose **Semantic IDs**—discrete codes derived from embeddings (vector representations of items)—that capture semantic relationships between items (e.g., two movies about space exploration might have similar Semantic IDs).

                The key problem: If you train embeddings separately for search and recommendation, they might not align well when used together in a *joint* generative model. The paper explores how to build Semantic IDs that generalize across both tasks, comparing strategies like:
                - Task-specific embeddings (e.g., one for search, one for recs).
                - Cross-task embeddings (shared across both).
                - Whether to use separate Semantic ID tokens for each task or a unified space.

                Their solution: **Use a bi-encoder model fine-tuned on *both* search and recommendation data to generate item embeddings, then map these to a unified Semantic ID space**. This balances performance across tasks without sacrificing specialization.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine you’re organizing a library where books can be found either by:
                1. **Search** (e.g., querying 'sci-fi books about Mars'), or
                2. **Recommendation** (e.g., 'If you liked *The Martian*, try these').

                Traditional IDs are like random barcode stickers on books—useless for understanding content. Semantic IDs are like **Dewey Decimal numbers on steroids**: they group books by topic *and* reader preferences. The paper’s method is akin to designing a single, smart numbering system that works for both librarians (search) and personalized reading lists (recommendations).

                    Generative models (e.g., LLMs) are being used to unify search and recommendation. For example:
                    - **Search**: Given a query like 'best wireless earbuds 2025', the model generates a list of relevant products.
                    - **Recommendation**: Given a user’s history, the model generates items they might like (e.g., 'Since you bought *Dune*, here’s *Hyperion*').

                    Both tasks rely on **item representations**. Traditional IDs (e.g., `product_9876`) force the model to memorize arbitrary mappings, which is inefficient. Semantic IDs (e.g., `[sci-fi, space-opera, 2020s]`) provide meaningful hints.

                    - **Recs**: Match user preferences to items (e.g., 'user likes bass-heavy audio' → earbuds with strong bass).

                    If you train separate embeddings for each task, their Semantic IDs might conflict in a joint model. For example:
                    - Search embedding might group earbuds by *technical specs*.
                    - Rec embedding might group them by *user demographics*.

                    - **Search relevance** (e.g., 'query about earbuds' → 'earbud items').
                    - **User preferences** (e.g., 'user who likes bass' → 'bass-heavy earbuds').

                    The embeddings are then quantized into discrete **Semantic IDs** (e.g., via clustering or vector quantization). These IDs are shared across tasks, enabling the generative model to use the same 'language' for search and recs.

                2. **Recommend movies** (e.g., 'Because you watched *Arrival*, here’s *Annihilation*').

                **Traditional Approach**:
                - Search: Uses a BM25 or dense retriever with arbitrary movie IDs.

                   - **Search**: Match query embeddings to movie Semantic IDs.

        This paper is about **giving items (like movies or products) 'smart names' that computers can understand**, instead of random numbers. These 'smart names' (Semantic IDs) describe what the item is about—like tags for a movie’s genre, themes, or style. The goal is to help AI systems that do *both* search (finding what you ask for) and recommendations (suggesting what you might like) work better together.

        **Why it’s hard**: Normally, search and recommendation systems use different 'languages' to describe items, which confuses AI when trying to do both jobs. The authors show that by creating a **shared 'language'** (unified Semantic IDs) trained on both tasks, the AI performs better at both—without needing separate systems.

        **Real-world impact**: Imagine asking Netflix for 'thrilling space movies like *Interstellar*' and getting perfect results *and* great recommendations afterward—all from the same AI, because it understands movies the same way for both tasks.

                LeanRAG is a new **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that fixes two big problems in current knowledge-graph-based RAGs:
                1. **Semantic Islands**: High-level knowledge summaries in graphs are disconnected (like isolated 'islands') with no explicit links between them, making cross-topic reasoning hard.

                **Solution**:
                - **Semantic Aggregation**: Groups related entities into clusters and *explicitly* builds new relationships between them, turning 'islands' into a connected network.
                - **Hierarchical Retrieval**: Starts with precise, fine-grained entities (bottom-up) and *systematically* traverses the graph’s structure to gather only the most relevant, non-redundant information.

            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_idea": "ParallelSearch is a new way to teach AI models (specifically LLMs) how to break down complex search queries into smaller, independent parts that can be processed simultaneously (in parallel) instead of one after another (sequentially). This is done using reinforcement learning (RL), where the AI is rewarded for correctly identifying which parts of a query can be split and processed at the same time, while still giving accurate answers.",

                "analogy": "Imagine you’re planning a trip and need to research 3 things: flights, hotels, and local attractions. Instead of looking up each one separately (flights → then hotels → then attractions), you could assign 3 friends to research each topic at the same time. ParallelSearch teaches the AI to act like a smart trip planner that *automatically* recognizes when tasks can be split up and done concurrently, saving time and effort.",

                "why_it_matters": "Current AI search agents (like Search-R1) process queries step-by-step, even when parts of the query don’t depend on each other. This is slow and inefficient, especially for complex questions (e.g., 'Compare the GDP, population, and life expectancy of France, Germany, and Italy'). ParallelSearch speeds this up by doing independent searches at the same time, like a team of researchers instead of a single person."

This wastes time and computational resources.",
                    "example": "For a query like 'What are the capitals of France, Germany, and Spain?', a sequential agent would search for France’s capital, then Germany’s, then Spain’s. ParallelSearch would recognize these are independent and search for all three at once."

            1. **Liability**: If an AI agent causes harm (e.g., a self-driving car crashes, an AI trading bot triggers a market collapse), *who is legally responsible*? Traditional liability frameworks assume human actors, but AI agents blur this line.
            2. **Value Alignment**: How does the law ensure AI systems align with human values? Current regulations (e.g., GDPR, AI Act) focus on *processes* (transparency, bias mitigation), but the post hints at deeper philosophical-legal gaps when AI systems *interpret* or *prioritize* values independently.

            The authors (Riedl + legal scholar Deven Desai) argue these questions require rethinking **human agency law**—the legal principles governing who/what can act with intent, responsibility, and moral accountability—when applied to non-human agents."

            *Example*: If an AI hiring tool discriminates, is the *company* liable (like a biased manager), the *developer* (like a negligent toolmaker), or the *AI* (like a rogue employee)?

        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_idea": "Galileo is a **multimodal transformer model** designed to process diverse remote sensing data (e.g., satellite images, radar, elevation maps, weather data) to solve tasks like crop mapping or flood detection. Unlike prior models that specialize in one data type, Galileo learns **shared representations** across many modalities *simultaneously*, while handling objects of vastly different scales (e.g., a 2-pixel boat vs. a glacier spanning thousands of pixels).",

                "key_challenge": "Remote sensing data is messy:
                - **Modality diversity**: Optical, radar, elevation, weather, etc., each have unique statistical properties.
                - **Scale variability**: Objects of interest range from tiny (boats) to massive (glaciers) and change at different speeds.
                - **Task heterogeneity**: Models must generalize across tasks like classification, segmentation, or time-series forecasting.
                Prior models either focus on single modalities or fail to capture multi-scale patterns effectively.",

                "solution_overview": "Galileo uses **self-supervised learning** (no labeled data needed) with two innovations:
                1. **Masked modeling**: Hides parts of input data and trains the model to reconstruct them, forcing it to learn meaningful features.
                2. **Dual contrastive losses**:
                   - *Global loss*: Compares deep representations of masked/unmasked data (captures high-level semantics).
                   - *Local loss*: Compares shallow input projections with structured masking (preserves fine-grained details).
                This combination ensures the model learns both **coarse global patterns** (e.g., land cover types) and **local textures** (e.g., crop health variations)."

                - **Traditional approach**: Give them separate lessons on tree species (optical data), soil moisture (radar), and topography (elevation). They might memorize each but miss how they interact.
                - **Galileo’s approach**: Blindfold the student, hide random patches of the forest, and ask them to describe what’s missing—first by guessing the overall ecosystem (*global loss*), then by identifying individual leaves or roots (*local loss*). Over time, they develop an intuitive, unified understanding of the forest *as a system*."

Think of it like organizing a workspace for a human assistant: where you place tools, how you label folders, and how you remind them of priorities all affect their productivity. For AI agents, this 'workspace' is the *context*—the input data (prompts, past actions, observations) fed to the model at each step.",

                "why_it_matters": "Unlike traditional software, AI agents rely on *in-context learning*—they adapt their behavior based on the information you provide *during runtime*, not just pre-trained knowledge. Poor context design leads to:
                - **High costs**: Wasted tokens in the KV-cache (a memory optimization for LLMs) inflate inference costs.
                - **Slow performance**: Long contexts or cache misses increase latency.
                - **Unreliable behavior**: Agents forget goals, repeat mistakes, or hallucinate actions.

                **SemRAG** is a smarter way to help AI models (like chatbots or search tools) answer questions *more accurately* by combining two key ideas:
                1. **Semantic Chunking**: Instead of splitting documents into random chunks (e.g., fixed-size paragraphs), SemRAG groups sentences that *mean similar things* together using math (cosine similarity of embeddings). This keeps related ideas intact, like clustering all sentences about 'photosynthesis' in a biology textbook.
                2. **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a *map of connections* (e.g., 'Einstein' → 'relativity' → '1905'). This helps the AI see *relationships* between facts, not just isolated pieces.

                **Why it matters**: Traditional AI either:
                - Needs *expensive training* (fine-tuning) to learn domain-specific info (e.g., medical terms), or
                - Retrieves *irrelevant chunks* (e.g., mixing up 'Python the snake' with 'Python the programming language').
                SemRAG avoids both by *structuring knowledge* before feeding it to the AI, making answers more precise *without* retraining the entire model.

                Imagine you’re studying for an exam:
                - **Old RAG**: You highlight random sentences in your textbook and hope they’re useful. Some might be about the wrong topic.
                - **SemRAG**:
                  1. You *group* all highlights about the same concept (e.g., 'mitosis' vs. 'meiosis').
                  2. You draw a *mind map* linking 'mitosis' to 'cell division' → 'chromosomes' → 'DNA replication'.
                Now, when asked 'What happens during mitosis?', you can *follow the map* to the exact right notes.

                    - **Step 1**: Convert each sentence in a document into a *vector* (a list of numbers representing its meaning) using a pre-trained model (e.g., Sentence-BERT).
                    - **Step 2**: Compare vectors using *cosine similarity* (a math trick to measure how 'close' their meanings are).
                    - **Step 3**: Group sentences with high similarity into *chunks*. For example:
                      ```
                      Document: 'The Eiffel Tower is in Paris. Paris is the capital of France. The Tower was built in 1889.'

                      ```
                    - **Why better?** Avoids splitting 'Paris' and 'Eiffel Tower' into separate chunks, which could confuse the AI.

        - **No fine-tuning needed**—just preprocess documents into chunks/graphs.
        - **Scalable** for domain-specific apps (medicine, law, etc.).

                "core_idea": "
                **Problem**: Decoder-only LLMs (like those used in chatbots) are *unidirectional*—they process text left-to-right with a 'causal mask' that blocks future tokens from influencing current ones. This makes them poor at *bidirectional* tasks like semantic search or retrieval, where understanding context from *both* directions (e.g., a query and a document) is critical.

                **Existing Solutions**:
                - **Bidirectional Hacks**: Remove the causal mask to let tokens 'see' future context (like BERT), but this risks breaking the LLM’s pretrained knowledge.
                - **Extra Text Tricks**: Add prompts like 'Summarize this document for retrieval' to coax the LLM into better embeddings, but this slows inference and adds computational cost.

                **Causal2Vec’s Innovation**:
                - **Step 1**: Use a tiny *BERT-style* model (not the full LLM) to pre-process the input text into a single **Contextual Token** (like a compressed summary of the entire text’s meaning).
                - **Step 2**: Prepend this token to the LLM’s input. Now, even with causal attention, the LLM ‘sees’ the *gist* of the full context upfront via this token.
                - **Step 3**: For the final embedding, combine the hidden states of the **Contextual Token** (global meaning) and the **EOS token** (last-token bias mitigation). This balances recency and context.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine reading a book with a *spoiler summary* taped to the first page. Even if you read linearly (like a decoder LLM), the summary gives you the 'big picture' upfront. Causal2Vec’s Contextual Token is like that spoiler—it lets the LLM ‘cheat’ at being bidirectional without rewiring its architecture.

                    "why": "
                    - **Efficiency**: The BERT-style model is small (low overhead) and runs *once* per input, reducing the sequence length the LLM must process by up to 85%.
                    - **Compatibility**: The LLM’s causal attention isn’t modified—it just gets a ‘head start’ from the Contextual Token.

                    1. Input text → BERT-style encoder → 1 Contextual Token.
                    2. Prepend this token to the original text (now shorter, since the token replaces much of the context).
                    3. LLM processes the sequence *with* the token, so every token ‘attends’ to the global context indirectly.

                    - **Recency Bias**: LLMs often overemphasize the last few tokens (e.g., in 'last-token pooling'). The EOS token captures this but may miss broader context.
                    - **Contextual Token**: Provides the ‘big picture’ but might lack nuance from the end of the text.
                    - **Combined**: Balances both, like mixing a wide-angle lens (Contextual) with a zoom lens (EOS).

Instead of relying on expensive human annotators, the system uses *ensembles of AI agents* to collaboratively decompose user intents, deliberate on policy compliance, and refine reasoning chains. The result is a **29% average performance boost** across benchmarks, with dramatic improvements in safety (e.g., 96% reduction in policy violations for Mixtral) and jailbreak robustness (e.g., 94% safe response rate vs. 51% baseline).",

                "analogy": "Imagine a team of expert lawyers (the AI agents) reviewing a contract (the user query). One lawyer breaks down the client’s goals (*intent decomposition*), another drafts a response (*initial CoT*), a third checks for legal compliance (*deliberation*), and a final lawyer polishes the document (*refinement*). The team’s collaborative process ensures the contract is airtight—just as the multiagent system ensures the LLM’s reasoning is policy-compliant and robust."

The authors propose a **3-part solution**:
                - **Prompt Engineering**: Designing input prompts that guide the LLM to focus on clustering/retrieval tasks (e.g., adding instructions like *'Represent this sentence for semantic search'*).
                - **Token Aggregation**: Experimenting with ways to combine the LLM’s token-level outputs into a single embedding (e.g., averaging, using the last token, or attention-weighted pooling).
                - **Contrastive Fine-tuning**: Lightweight tuning (using **LoRA**) on *synthetically generated* positive/negative pairs to teach the model to distinguish similar vs. dissimilar texts, without overhauling the entire LLM.",

                    - **Retrieval**: Finding relevant passages (e.g., in a search engine) needs embeddings where *'cat'* is closer to *'feline'* than *'hat'*.

                This paper introduces **HALoGEN**, a benchmark to systematically measure and classify **hallucinations** in large language models (LLMs). Hallucinations are false or misleading statements generated by LLMs that conflict with real-world knowledge or input context. The challenge is that detecting these errors manually is slow and expensive, so the authors built an automated system to:
                - **Test LLMs** across 9 domains (e.g., coding, science, summarization) using 10,923 prompts.
                - **Verify outputs** by breaking them into small 'atomic facts' and checking them against trusted knowledge sources (e.g., databases, reference texts).
                - **Classify errors** into 3 types based on their likely cause (more on this below).

                **Key finding**: Even top LLMs hallucinate *a lot*—up to **86% of atomic facts** in some domains were incorrect.

                This paper investigates a critical flaw in **language model (LM) re-rankers**—tools used in **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to improve search results by reordering retrieved documents based on semantic relevance. The key finding is that these advanced models (which are computationally expensive) often **fail to outperform simpler lexical matching methods like BM25** when documents share few *surface-level word overlaps* with the query, even if they are semantically relevant. The authors call this the **lexical similarity bias**: LM re-rankers are 'fooled' into downgrading semantically correct answers if they lack lexical overlap with the query.

                Imagine you’re a judge in a baking contest. A simple rule-based judge (BM25) picks winners based on whether the cake *looks* like the recipe (e.g., 'chocolate cake' must contain 'chocolate' and 'flour'). A sophisticated judge (LM re-ranker) is supposed to understand *flavor* (semantics)—like recognizing a gluten-free chocolate cake as valid even if it lacks wheat flour. But the study finds the sophisticated judge often *still penalizes* the gluten-free cake because it doesn’t match the expected ingredients list, even though it tastes correct.

            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_idea": "This paper tackles a real-world problem: **court systems are drowning in backlogged cases**, much like overcrowded emergency rooms. The authors propose a solution inspired by medical triage—**a system to prioritize legal cases based on their potential 'criticality'** (i.e., how influential or important they’re likely to become). The key innovation is a **dataset and methodology to predict which court decisions will be widely cited (and thus influential) in the future**, using **multilingual Swiss legal texts** as a testbed.",

                "analogy": "Think of it like a **legal 'viral prediction' tool**. Just as social media platforms predict which posts will go viral, this system predicts which court rulings will become 'leading decisions' (highly cited) or gather citations over time. The difference? Instead of likes/shares, the 'currency' is **citations in future legal cases**—a proxy for influence.",

                "why_it_matters": "If courts could **prioritize cases likely to set precedents or require deeper scrutiny**, they could:
                - Reduce backlogs by focusing resources on high-impact cases.
                - Improve consistency in rulings (since influential cases shape future law).
                - Save time/money by deprioritizing routine cases.
                This is especially useful in **multilingual systems** (like Switzerland’s, with German/French/Italian rulings), where manual review is even more labor-intensive."

                    - Rely on **manual annotation** (slow, expensive, small datasets).
                    - Use **simple metrics** (e.g., case age) that ignore nuance.
                    The authors argue for a **data-driven, scalable approach** to predict a case’s future influence.",
                    "example": "A minor tax dispute might clutter dockets for years, while a landmark constitutional case lingers unnoticed—until it’s cited 100 times. The goal is to **spot the latter early**."
