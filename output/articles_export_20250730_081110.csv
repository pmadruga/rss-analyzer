Language Model Re-rankers are Fooled by Lexical Similarities,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17036,2025-07-29T22:40:29+00:00,2025-07-30 08:07:16,"Imagine you're in a library looking for a specific book, but the librarian gives you a stack of books that might contain the information you need. You have to quickly decide which book is most likely to have the answer. This is similar to what language model (LM) re-rankers do in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). They help refine the initial set of retrieved documents to find the most relevant ones.

Our research started with a fundamental question: Are LM re-rankers always better than si...","Our main discoveries were:

1. **LM Re-rankers Struggle**: Surprisingly, LM re-rankers didn't always outperform the simple BM25 baseline, especially on the DRUID dataset. This is like finding out that the advanced librarian isn't always better than the one who just counts keyword matches.

2. **Lexical Dissimilarities**: We found that LM re-rankers often make mistakes when the query and the relevant document use different words for the same concepts. This is like the librarian being confused ...","Think of LM re-rankers as advanced librarians who use complex algorithms to understand the content of books. Here's how we technically implemented our study:

1. **LM Re-rankers**: These are models like BERT or RoBERTa that can understand the context and semantics of text. They work by taking a query and a set of documents, then scoring each document based on how well it answers the query.

2. **BM25 Baseline**: BM25 is a simpler algorithm that scores documents based on how many query keyword...","Our study was designed to answer the question: Are LM re-rankers always better than simpler methods? Here's how we set it up:

1. **Dataset Selection**: We chose NQ, LitQA2, and DRUID because they represent different types of queries and documents. This helps us understand how LM re-rankers perform in various scenarios.

2. **Baseline Comparison**: Comparing LM re-rankers to BM25 helps us see if the added complexity of LM re-rankers is worth it. It's like comparing an advanced librarian to a ..."
