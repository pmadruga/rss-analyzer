The key innovation is replacing traditional numeric IDs (e.g., `item_12345`) with **Semantic IDs**—machine-readable codes that *encode meaningful information* about the item (e.g., its category, features, or relationships to other items).\n\n                The problem: If you train separate embeddings (vector representations) for search and recommendation, they won’t work well together in a unified model. The solution: **Create a shared Semantic ID space** that balances both tasks by fine-tuning a *bi-encoder* (a model that maps items and queries to the same embedding space) on *both* search and recommendation data.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of Semantic IDs like **DNA barcodes for products**:\n                - Traditional IDs are like random serial numbers (e.g., `SKU-987654321`).

If you *remove* knives mid-recipe, the chef might panic or grab the wrong tool. Instead, *cover* the knives they shouldn’t use with a cloth (logit masking).\n                    **Problem**: Dynamically adding/removing tools breaks the KV-cache (tools are usually defined early in context) and confuses the model if past actions reference missing tools.\n                    **Solution**:\n                    1. **Logit masking**: Use the model’s constrained decoding to *hide* irrelevant tools without removing their definitions. For example:\n                       - Prefill tokens to force a specific action subset (e.g., `<tool_call>{\"name\": \"browser_`).\n                       - Design tool names with prefixes (e.g., `browser_get`, `shell_ls`) to mask by category.\n                    2. **State machines**: Let the agent’s state (not the context) determine tool availability.\n                    **Example**: Manus uses a finite-state machine to enforce rules like:\n                    - *State: ‘Awaiting user input’* → Mask all tools (force text response).\n                    - *State: ‘Browsing’* → Only unmask `browser_*` tools.\n                    **Why it works**: The model still *sees* all tools (preserving cache), but can’t select the wrong ones.\",\n                    \"tradeoffs\": [\n                        \"+ Preserves KV-cache and context stability.\",\n                        \"+ Simpler than dynamic tool loading.\",\n                        \"- Requires upfront design of tool hierarchies/prefixes.\",\n                        \"- Not all models support advanced logit masking (e.g., some APIs only allow ‘auto’ or ‘required’ function calling).\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"principle\": \"Use the File System as Context\",\n                \"feynman_explanation\": {\n                    \"analogy\": \"An agent’s context window is like a whiteboard: limited space, and erasing something might be permanent.

Aggressive truncation/compression risks losing critical data.\n                    **Solution**:\n                    1. **Externalize memory**: Teach the agent to read/write files instead of stuffing everything into context. For example:\n                       - Store a webpage’s HTML in `/tmp/webpage_123.html` and keep only the URL in context.\n                       - Save intermediate results (e.g., parsed data) to files and reference paths.\n                    2. **Lossless compression**: Only remove data that can be restored (e.g., drop a document’s content but keep its path).\n                    **Design implications**:\n                    - The agent needs *file I/O tools* (e.g., `fs_read`, `fs_write`).\n                    - The sandbox must be persistent across steps (unlike stateless APIs).\n                    - **Future potential**: This approach could enable *State Space Models (SSMs)* to work as agents, since they struggle with long in-context memory but could excel with external storage.\",\n                    \"example_workflow\": [\n                        \"1.
