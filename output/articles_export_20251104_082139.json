Orders dishes with tricky requirements (e.g., 'gluten-free but spicy' = complex queries).\n                  - Sometimes swaps labels on ingredients (perturbations) to see if the chef notices.\n                  -

Just like hospitals use triage to prioritize patients, the authors propose a system to prioritize legal cases based on their *potential influence* (e.g., whether they’ll become landmark rulings or frequently cited precedents). The key innovation is a **dataset** (the *Criticality Prediction dataset*) that labels Swiss court decisions in two ways:\n                - **Binary LD-Label**: Is this case a *Leading Decision* (LD, i.e., a high-impact ruling)?\n                - **Citation-Label**: How often and recently has this case been cited? (A proxy for influence.)\n                The labels are generated *algorithmically* (not manually), enabling a much larger dataset than prior work.\n\n                The authors then test whether **AI models** (small fine-tuned ones vs. large language models like LLMs) can predict these labels.
