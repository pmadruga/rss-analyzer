These satellites collect *many types of data*:\n            - **Optical images** (like photos, but with extra colors humans can’t see, e.g., infrared).\n            - **Radar data** (which works day/night, even through clouds).\n            - **Elevation maps** (3D terrain).\n            - **Weather data** (temperature, rain, etc.).\n            - **Pseudo-labels** (noisy or imperfect labels, like crowdsourced annotations).\n\n            The problem? These data types are *totally different*—like comparing a photo, a soundwave, and a topographic map. Plus, things we care about (e.g., a tiny boat vs. a massive glacier) vary *wildly in size and speed*. Existing AI models usually focus on *one* data type or *one* task (e.g., only crop mapping). This paper introduces **Galileo**, a single AI model that:\n            1. **Handles all these data types at once** (multimodal).\n            2. **Learns features at every scale** (from 1-pixel boats to continent-sized storms).\n            3. **Works without labeled data** (self-supervised learning).\n            4. **Beats specialized models** across 11 different tasks (flood detection, crop mapping, etc.).\n\n            **Key innovation**: A *dual contrastive loss* that forces the model to learn both:\n            - **Global features** (big-picture patterns, like 'this region is a forest').\n            - **Local features** (fine details, like 'this pixel is a boat').\n            It does this by *masking* parts of the input (like covering parts of a puzzle) and training the model to reconstruct or compare them.\n            \",\n            \"analogy\": \"\n            Think of Galileo like a **universal translator for Earth’s data**.

This keeps the context intact.\n                   - *Example*: In a medical paper, sentences about ‘symptoms of diabetes’ stay grouped, while unrelated sections (e.g., ‘treatment costs’) are separated.\n                2. **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a *graph* showing relationships between entities (e.g., ‘Drug X → treats → Disease Y → caused by → Gene Z’). This helps the AI ‘see’ connections it might miss in raw text.\n                3. **Optimized Buffer Sizes**: Adjusts how much data to fetch based on the dataset (e.g., a dense medical corpus vs. sparse Wikipedia articles) to avoid overwhelming the model with noise.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Think of SemRAG like a **librarian with a superpower**:\n                - Instead of handing you random book pages (traditional RAG), they:\n                  1. **Group related pages** (semantic chunking) so you get a full chapter on your topic.\n                  2. **Draw a map** (knowledge graph) showing how ideas connect (e.g., ‘This drug → affects this protein → linked to this side effect’).\n                  3. **Adjust their search strategy** (buffer size) depending on whether you’re in a tiny library (niche dataset) or the Library of Congress (Wikipedia).\n                \"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components_deep_dive\": {\n                \"semantic_chunking\": {\n                    \"how_it_works\": \"\n                    - Uses **sentence embeddings** (e.g., from models like Sentence-BERT) to convert sentences into vectors (lists of numbers representing meaning).\n                    - Measures **cosine similarity** between sentences: high similarity → group together;
