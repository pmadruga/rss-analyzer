1. **BERT-style Model for Pre-encoding**: We use a BERT-style model, which is good at understanding context from both directions (bidirectional). This model takes the input text and compresses it into a single Contextual token. It's like creating a highly condensed version of the text that still retains its meaning.

2. **Prepending the Contextual Token**: By adding this token to the start of the input sequence for the LLM, we ensure that every ...","To design our study, we focused on addressing the limitations of existing methods while keeping computational efficiency in mind. Here's our reasoning:

1. **Choice of BERT-style Model**: We chose a lightweight BERT-style model for pre-encoding because it's efficient and effective at capturing bidirectional context, which is crucial for creating meaningful embeddings.
