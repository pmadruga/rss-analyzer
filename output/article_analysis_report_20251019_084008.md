                This paper tackles a fundamental problem in **information retrieval (IR)**: how to find *semantically relevant* documents (not just keyword-matching ones) when the documents and queries come from specialized domains (e.g., medicine, law, or engineering). The key challenge is that generic knowledge graphs (like Wikipedia-based ones) often lack **domain-specific nuances** or rely on outdated information, leading to poor precision in retrieval results.

                The authors propose a two-part solution:
                1. **Algorithm**: A new method called *Semantic-based Concept Retrieval using Group Steiner Tree* (SemDR) that weaves **domain knowledge** into the retrieval process to better understand relationships between concepts.
                2. **System**: A real-world implementation of this algorithm, tested on 170 real queries, showing **90% precision** and **82% accuracy**—significant improvements over baseline systems.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine you’re searching for medical research papers about 'heart failure treatments.' A traditional search engine might return papers mentioning 'heart' and 'failure' but miss critical nuances (e.g., distinguishing *systolic* vs. *diastolic* heart failure). The SemDR system is like having a **cardiologist co-pilot** who understands the *semantic links* between terms (e.g., 'ejection fraction' → 'systolic dysfunction') and filters results using up-to-date clinical guidelines.

                    A **Steiner Tree** is a graph theory concept: the smallest network connecting a set of points (e.g., cities) with minimal total edge weight. A **Group Steiner Tree** extends this to connect *multiple groups* of points (e.g., clusters of related concepts in a knowledge graph).

                    In this paper, the algorithm:
                    - Treats **query terms** and **document concepts** as nodes in a graph.
                    - Uses domain knowledge to assign **weights** to edges (e.g., 'diabetes' → 'metformin' has a stronger weight than 'diabetes' → 'aspirin').
                    - Finds the optimal 'tree' linking query terms to document concepts, prioritizing paths enriched by domain-specific relationships.

                    Traditional retrieval systems (e.g., BM25, TF-IDF) treat terms as isolated keywords. Even semantic models (e.g., BERT) may miss domain-specific hierarchies. The Group Steiner Tree forces the system to consider **how concepts relate** within the domain, not just their co-occurrence.

                    The system augments generic knowledge graphs (e.g., DBpedia) with **domain-specific resources**:
                    - **Ontologies**: Formal hierarchies (e.g., MeSH for medicine, WordNet for general language).
                    - **Expert-curated rules**: E.g., 'if a document mentions 'ACE inhibitors,' it’s likely relevant to 'hypertension treatment.''
                    - **Dynamic updates**: Incorporates recent domain changes (e.g., new drug interactions) to avoid relying on stale data.

                    Without this, a query for 'COVID-19 treatments' might return outdated papers on hydroxychloroquine (pre-2021) or miss newer studies on Paxlovid. Domain enrichment ensures the system 'knows' the current standard of care.

                This paper is about **AI agents that can *improve themselves over time***—like a robot or software assistant that doesn’t just follow pre-programmed rules but *learns from its experiences* and *adapts* to new situations. Think of it like a video game character that starts weak but gets smarter and more skilled the more you play, except here, the 'character' is an AI system operating in the real world (e.g., managing finances, writing code, or diagnosing diseases).

                The **big problem** it addresses:
                Today’s AI agents (like chatbots or automated assistants) are usually *static*—they’re trained once and then deployed, with no way to update themselves when the world changes. This survey explores how to make agents *dynamic*: able to evolve based on feedback, new data, or even their own mistakes.

                2. **Watch customers’ reactions** (user interactions) to refine presentations.

        Today’s AI is like a textbook—smart but static. This survey explores how to create AI that’s more like a **mentor or colleague**: it starts with basic knowledge but *keeps learning* from its experiences, mistakes, and feedback. For example:
        - A **doctor’s assistant** that reads new research papers *on its own* and updates its advice.
        - A **personal finance bot** that notices you’re saving for a house and adjusts its budgeting tips.
        - A **coding partner** that learns your style and suggests improvements over time.

        The catch? We need to ensure these agents don’t go rogue (e.g., a trading bot that becomes too risky) or forget old skills (like a chef who only cooks trendy dishes and forgets the classics). This paper is a **guidebook** for building such systems safely and effectively.

                "core_idea": "This paper introduces a **graph-based transformer model** to improve **patent search** (finding 'prior art'—existing patents/documents that might invalidate a new patent claim). Traditional text-based search struggles with:
                - **Volume**: Millions of patents to sift through.
                - **Nuance**: Patents require understanding *relationships* between technical features, not just keywords.
                - **Efficiency**: Long documents are computationally expensive to process.

                The solution? Represent each patent as a **graph** (nodes = features, edges = relationships) and use a **Graph Transformer** to:
                1. Encode the graph into a dense vector (embedding).
                2. Compare embeddings to find similar patents, trained using **real examiner citations** (gold-standard relevance signals).",

                "analogy": "Imagine patents as LEGO constructions. Instead of describing them as a flat list of bricks (text), we build a 3D map (graph) showing how bricks connect. The transformer is like a robot that learns to recognize similar LEGO structures by watching how human experts (patent examiners) group them."

The authors propose **Semantic IDs**—compact, meaningful codes derived from item embeddings—that capture semantic relationships (e.g., two movies about space exploration might have similar Semantic IDs).

                LeanRAG is a new **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that fixes two big problems in current knowledge-graph-based RAG:
                1. **Semantic Islands**: High-level summaries in knowledge graphs are disconnected (like isolated 'islands' of information) with no explicit links between them, making cross-topic reasoning hard.
                2. **Flat Retrieval**: Existing systems search the graph like a flat list, ignoring its hierarchical structure, which wastes resources and retrieves redundant/irrelevant data.

                **How LeanRAG solves this**:
                - **Step 1 (Semantic Aggregation)**: Groups related entities into clusters and builds explicit links between them, turning 'islands' into a connected 'network'.
                - **Step 2 (Hierarchical Retrieval)**: Starts with the most relevant fine-grained entities (bottom-up), then navigates the graph’s structure to gather only the necessary context, avoiding redundant data.
                - **Result**: Faster, more accurate answers with **46% less retrieval overhead** compared to prior methods.

If you ask, *'How does quantum mechanics relate to chemical bonds?'*, the librarian would have to search every shelf randomly (flat retrieval). LeanRAG is like:
                1. **Adding cross-references** between sections (semantic aggregation), so 'Physics' points to 'Chemistry' where relevant.
                2. **Starting your search at the 'Quantum Mechanics' subsection**, then following only the linked paths to 'Chemical Bonds' (hierarchical retrieval), ignoring irrelevant books.

            2. **Then**, when you ask for a spaceship, it starts with the *wing pieces* (not the whole box) and follows the sticky notes to grab only what you need (hierarchical retrieval).
            Now you build faster, and your spaceship doesn’t have extra wheels or flowers stuck to it!

    "analysis": {
        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_idea": "ParallelSearch is a new way to teach AI models (specifically large language models or LLMs) how to break down complex search queries into smaller, independent parts that can be processed *simultaneously* instead of one after another. This is done using **reinforcement learning (RL)**, where the model is rewarded for correctly identifying which parts of a query can be handled in parallel and for doing so efficiently.",

                "analogy": "Imagine you’re planning a trip and need to research three things: 1) flight options, 2) hotel availability, and 3) local attractions. Instead of doing them one by one (sequential), you ask three friends to look up each task at the same time (parallel). ParallelSearch teaches the AI to recognize when tasks like these can be split up and done concurrently, saving time and resources.",

                "why_it_matters": "Current AI search agents (like Search-R1) process queries step-by-step, even when parts of the query don’t depend on each other. This is slow and wasteful. ParallelSearch fixes this by:
                - **Decomposing queries**: Splitting a complex question into independent sub-queries (e.g., 'Compare the populations of France, Germany, and Italy in 2023' → 3 separate population lookups).
                - **Parallel execution**: Running these sub-queries at the same time, like a team dividing tasks.
                - **Reinforcement learning**: Training the model to get better at this by rewarding it for correctness, good decomposition, and efficiency."

                    "sequential_bottleneck": "Existing RL-trained search agents (e.g., Search-R1) process queries sequentially, even when parts are logically independent. For example, comparing multiple entities (e.g., 'Which is taller: the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, or Burj Khalifa?') requires 3 separate searches, but they’re done one after another, wasting time.",
                    "inefficiency": "This sequential approach leads to higher computational costs (more LLM calls) and slower responses, especially for queries with many independent comparisons."

                    2. **Parallel Execution**: Sub-queries are processed concurrently, reducing total time.
                    3. **RL Rewards**: The model is trained with a custom reward system that incentivizes:
                       - **Correctness**: Ensuring the final answer is accurate.
                       - **Decomposition Quality**: Splitting queries into truly independent parts.

                "explanation": "This post (and the linked paper) examines how **existing legal frameworks for human agency**—like liability laws—might (or might not) apply to **AI agents** (e.g., autonomous systems, LLMs, or robotic decision-makers). The key tension is:
                - **Traditional law** assumes liability ties to *human intent* or *negligence*.
                - **AI agents** act without human-like intent, raising questions:
                  - *Who is liable* when an AI causes harm? (Developer? User? AI itself?)
                  - How do we enforce *value alignment* (e.g., ethical constraints) if the AI’s goals conflict with human laws or norms?

                The paper argues that legal systems must adapt to address these gaps, likely proposing frameworks for **attributing responsibility** to AI designers, deployers, or even the AI’s 'corporate personhood' in extreme cases.",

                **Galileo** is a new AI model designed to understand *many types of remote sensing data* (like satellite images, radar, elevation maps, weather data, etc.) *all at once*. Unlike older models that focus on just one type of data (e.g., only optical images), Galileo can combine *diverse inputs* to solve problems like tracking crops, detecting floods, or monitoring glaciers—even when the objects of interest vary wildly in size (from tiny boats to massive glaciers) and speed (fast-moving storms vs. slow-moving ice).

                The key innovation is a **self-supervised learning** approach (no manual labels needed!) that:
                - Uses **masked modeling** (hiding parts of the data and predicting them, like a puzzle).
                - Applies **two contrastive losses** (a technique to compare similar/dissimilar data points):
                  - *Global loss*: Compares deep representations (high-level features) of masked vs. unmasked data.
                  - *Local loss*: Compares raw input projections (low-level features) with different masking strategies.
                - Handles **multi-scale features** (small details *and* big-picture context) in one model.

                Imagine you’re a detective analyzing a crime scene. Older models are like specialists who only look at fingerprints (*optical images*) or footprints (*radar data*). Galileo is like a *generalist detective* who cross-references fingerprints, footprints, weather reports, terrain maps, and even rough sketches (pseudo-labels) to solve cases *without being told what to look for*. It learns by playing a game: ‘If I cover up part of the scene, can I guess what’s missing?’—and it does this for *all types of evidence* at once.

            "definition": "Context engineering is the deliberate design and optimization of the input context (e.g., prompts, memory, tool definitions, and environmental state) provided to an LLM-based agent to maximize its performance, efficiency, and reliability. Unlike traditional fine-tuning, it leverages *in-context learning*—the ability of modern LLMs to adapt behavior based on the input context alone—without modifying the underlying model weights. This approach enables rapid iteration (hours vs. weeks) and decouples the agent's logic from the model's architecture, making it 'orthogonal' to advancements in base models (e.g., GPT-4 → GPT-5).",

            "why_it_matters": "For agentic systems (where LLMs interact with tools/environments in loops), context engineering is the *primary lever* for improving behavior. The author argues that even as models improve, the *shape of the context* determines an agent's scalability, cost, and robustness. Poor context design leads to:
            - **High latency/cost**: Inefficient KV-cache usage (e.g., 10x cost difference between cached/uncached tokens in Claude Sonnet).
            - **Brittleness**: Agents fail to recover from errors or drift off-task in long loops.
            - **Information loss**: Critical observations are truncated or compressed irreversibly.
            - **Hallucinations**: Dynamic tool spaces or few-shot examples mislead the model."

Without optimization, this leads to high prefilling costs and latency.",

                **SemRAG** is a smarter way to help AI models (like chatbots or search tools) answer questions *accurately* in specialized fields (e.g., medicine, law, or finance) *without* needing to retrain the entire model from scratch. It does this by:
                - **Breaking documents into meaningful chunks** (not just random sentences) using *semantic similarity* (e.g., grouping sentences about 'symptoms of diabetes' together).
                - **Organizing these chunks into a knowledge graph** (a map of how concepts relate, like 'insulin → treats → diabetes').
                - **Retrieving only the most relevant chunks** when answering a question, then using the graph to 'connect the dots' for better context.

                **Why it matters**: Traditional AI either (1) gives vague answers (if not fine-tuned) or (2) requires expensive retraining for each new domain. SemRAG avoids both by *augmenting* the AI with structured knowledge on-the-fly.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine you’re a librarian helping a student research 'climate change effects on coral reefs.' Instead of handing them random pages from books (traditional RAG), you:
                1. **Group pages by topic** (e.g., 'bleaching,' 'ocean acidification').
                2. **Draw a map** showing how these topics link (e.g., 'CO2 → acidification → weaker coral skeletons').
                3. **Give them only the relevant pages + the map** so they see the full picture.

                SemRAG does this automatically for AI.

                    Instead of splitting documents by fixed lengths (e.g., 100 words), SemRAG uses **sentence embeddings** (numeric representations of meaning) to group *semantically related* sentences.

                **Problem**: Decoder-only LLMs (like GPT-style models) are great at generating text but struggle with *embedding tasks*—turning text into meaningful numerical vectors (e.g., for search, clustering, or retrieval). This is because:
                - They use **causal attention masks** (each token only sees previous tokens, not future ones), which limits their ability to understand *bidirectional context* (like BERT does).
                - Existing fixes either:
                  - Remove the mask entirely (hurting pretrained knowledge).
                  - Add extra input text (increasing compute costs).
                  - Use last-token pooling (biased toward the end of the text).

                **Solution**: *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny **BERT-style 'Contextual token'** to the *start* of the input sequence. This token:
                - Pre-encodes the *entire input* bidirectionally (like BERT) but is lightweight.
                - Acts as a 'context summary' for the LLM, so even with causal attention, every token gets some bidirectional awareness.
                - Combines with the EOS token’s hidden state to reduce 'recency bias' (over-focusing on the end of the text).

Now, even with the blindfold, you have a rough idea of what’s coming. At the end, you combine your last thought (EOS token) with that summary to form your final takeaway (the embedding).

            "simple_explanation": {
                "what": "This research introduces a **multiagent AI system** that generates high-quality **chain-of-thought (CoT) training data** to improve large language models' (LLMs) ability to follow **safety policies** (e.g., avoiding harmful, biased, or jailbreak responses). Instead of relying on expensive human annotators, the system uses **teams of AI agents** to collaboratively create, debate, and refine CoT explanations that embed policy compliance into the model's reasoning process.",

                "why_it_matters": "Current LLMs often struggle with **safety vs. utility trade-offs**—either being overly restrictive (e.g., refusing safe requests) or failing to block harmful ones. This method automates the creation of training data that teaches models to *reason about safety* while solving tasks, leading to **29% average performance improvements** across benchmarks like jailbreak robustness and overrefusal reduction."

                - **Refinement Agent** = A judge who filters out inconsistent or redundant arguments before issuing the final verdict.
                The output is a **transparent, policy-aligned reasoning chain** that the LLM can learn from, like a student studying annotated legal cases."

            1. **Agentic Collaboration**: Unlike single-LLM CoT generation, it uses *multiple specialized agents* to iteratively improve reasoning (like peer review in science).
            2. **Policy Embedding**: Agents explicitly cross-check reasoning against predefined safety policies (e.g., *‘Does this response avoid bias?’*), which is missing in traditional CoT.

                "core_idea": "This paper solves a key problem: **How can we efficiently turn large language models (LLMs) into high-quality text embedding generators without retraining them from scratch?** The authors propose a **three-part solution**:
                1. **Smart aggregation** of token-level embeddings (e.g., averaging or attention-weighted pooling).
                2. **Prompt engineering** to guide the LLM toward clustering-friendly representations (e.g., adding task-specific instructions like *'Represent this sentence for semantic clustering:'*).
                3. **Lightweight contrastive fine-tuning** (using LoRA) on *synthetically generated positive pairs* to align embeddings with semantic similarity, without full-model updates.

                **Why it matters**: LLMs excel at generating text but aren’t optimized for tasks like clustering or retrieval, which need compact, meaningful sentence/document embeddings. This method bridges that gap *efficiently* (low compute, no full fine-tuning).",

                "analogy": "Imagine an LLM as a chef who’s great at cooking full meals (generation) but struggles to make single, perfect *sauces* (embeddings) for other dishes. This paper teaches the chef to:
                - **Mix ingredients smartly** (aggregation),
                - **Follow a recipe card** (prompt engineering), and
                - **Tweak just the seasoning** (LoRA fine-tuning)
                to create sauces that work universally—without retraining the chef from scratch."

                This paper introduces **HALoGEN**, a benchmark designed to systematically measure and classify **hallucinations** in large language models (LLMs). Hallucinations are false or misleading statements generated by LLMs that conflict with real-world knowledge or input context. The key challenge addressed is the lack of scalable, reliable methods to detect these errors—human verification is slow and expensive, while automated checks often lack precision.

                The authors solve this by:
                - Creating a **dataset of 10,923 prompts** across 9 domains (e.g., programming, science, summarization).
                - Building **automated verifiers** that break LLM outputs into small, checkable 'atomic facts' and cross-reference them against trusted knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia, code repositories).
                - Evaluating **14 LLMs** (including state-of-the-art models) and finding that even the best models hallucinate **up to 86% of atomic facts** in some domains.
                - Proposing a **taxonomy of hallucination types**:
                  - **Type A**: Errors from *misremembering* training data (e.g., incorrect but plausible facts).
                  - **Type B**: Errors from *inherent flaws* in training data (e.g., outdated or biased sources).
                  - **Type C**: Pure *fabrications* (e.g., invented citations or events).

                2. Checks each sentence the student writes against a textbook or reliable source.

                "core_idea": "This paper tackles a real-world problem: **overwhelmed court systems** with massive case backlogs. The authors propose a solution inspired by medical triage—**prioritizing legal cases** based on their potential *influence* (e.g., likelihood of becoming a 'leading decision' or being frequently cited). The key innovation is a **two-tier labeling system** to train AI models to predict which cases deserve priority, using **Swiss jurisprudence** (a multilingual legal system) as the testbed.",

                "analogy": "Think of it like an ER doctor’s triage system, but for court cases. Instead of judging severity by symptoms, the AI judges a case’s *legal criticality*—will it set a precedent (like a 'leading decision') or be cited often (like a 'high-impact' medical study)? The authors build a dataset to teach AI to spot these 'critical' cases early, saving courts time and resources.",

                "why_it_matters": "Courts globally face delays (e.g., India’s 40M+ pending cases). If AI can flag cases likely to shape future rulings, judges could prioritize them, reducing backlogs and improving legal consistency. The Swiss context is especially interesting because it’s **multilingual** (German/French/Italian), adding complexity."

                "description": "
                This post is a **short announcement and analysis** by Sung Kim about **Moonshot AI’s new technical report for their Kimi K2 model**. The key points are:
                - Moonshot AI (a Chinese AI lab) published a detailed technical report for their latest model, **Kimi K2**.
                - The report is notable for its depth, especially compared to competitors like DeepSeek.
                - Three **major innovations** are highlighted:
                  1. **MuonClip**: Likely a new method for **aligning or optimizing model outputs** (possibly a variant of CLIP for multimodal tasks or a novel fine-tuning technique).
                  2. **Large-scale agentic data pipeline**: A system for **automating data collection/processing** to train agents (e.g., for tool use, reasoning, or autonomy).
                  3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework**: A custom approach to **improve model behavior via feedback loops** (e.g., RLHF, PPO, or a new hybrid method).

                The post links to the **full report on GitHub**, implying it’s open for public scrutiny.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Think of Kimi K2 like a **new recipe for a super-smart robot chef**:
                - **MuonClip** is the secret sauce that makes the food taste better (alignment/optimization).
                - The **agentic pipeline** is the automated kitchen that gathers ingredients (data) without human help.
                - The **RL framework** is the taste-testing process where the chef adjusts flavors (model behavior) based on feedback.

                    The name suggests a fusion of:
                    - **Muon**: Possibly a nod to *muon particles* (high-energy, precise) or a play on *multi-modal* (Mu + On).
                    - **CLIP**: Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining (OpenAI’s method for linking text and images).

                    **Likely purpose**:
                    - A **multimodal alignment technique** to improve how Kimi K2 understands/generates text *and* images/audio.
                    - Could involve **contrastive learning** (like CLIP) but with proprietary tweaks for efficiency or scale.
                    - Alternatively, a **fine-tuning method** to reduce hallucinations or bias (e.g., ‘clipping’ erroneous outputs).

                    "why_it_matters": "
                    If MuonClip outperforms CLIP or other alignment methods, it could give Kimi K2 an edge in **multimodal reasoning** (e.g., answering questions about charts, videos, or real-world scenarios).

                    ‘Agentic’ implies the pipeline isn’t just passive data collection—it likely involves:
                    - **Autonomous agents** (smaller AI models or scripts) that:
                      - Crawl the web for high-quality data.
                      - Filter/clean data (e.g., removing bias, duplicates).
                      - Generate synthetic data (e.g., simulated conversations for training).
                    - **Scalability**: Designed to handle **massive datasets** (e.g., trillions of tokens) efficiently.
                    - **Feedback loops**: Agents might iteratively improve data quality based on model performance.

                    Most AI labs struggle with **data quality at scale**. If Moonshot’s pipeline is truly agentic, it could **reduce human labor** and **improve model robustness** (e.g., fewer ‘lazy’ or incorrect responses).

                    RL in LLMs typically involves:
                    - **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback): Humans rate model outputs, and the model learns to maximize ‘good’ responses.
                    - **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization): A stable RL algorithm for fine-tuning.

                    Moonshot’s twist might include:
                    - **Automated feedback**: Using AI agents (not humans) to evaluate outputs (cheaper, faster).
                    - **Multi-objective RL**: Optimizing for **multiple goals** (e.g., accuracy *and* creativity *and* safety).
                    - **Hybrid methods**: Combining RL with other techniques (e.g., direct preference optimization).

                - **Competitive landscape**: Moonshot AI (backed by Alibaba) is competing with DeepSeek, Zhipu AI, and others in China’s LLM race. Their reports being ‘more detailed’ than DeepSeek’s suggests **transparency as a differentiator**.
                - **Technical depth**: Most labs release vague blog posts; a **full technical report** (like Anthropic’s or Mistral’s) signals serious R&D.

        Moonshot AI just shared the ‘recipe’ for their latest AI model, Kimi K2. Three big ideas stand out:
        1. **MuonClip**: A new way to help the AI understand images/text together (like teaching a robot to describe a photo accurately).
        2. **Agentic Data Pipeline**: A smart system to automatically gather and clean training data (like a robot librarian that finds the best books).
        3. **Reinforcement Learning**: A method to train the AI by rewarding good answers (like giving a dog treats for sitting).

        Why it’s exciting: If these work well, Kimi K2 could be **smarter, faster to train, and better at complex tasks** than other AI models. But we need to read the full report to know for sure!

                This paper tackles a fundamental problem in **Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation**:
                *How do we reliably determine if one search system (e.g., Google vs. Bing) is better than another when we don’t have perfect relevance judgments?*

                **Key Challenge**:
                - Evaluating IR systems requires **human-labeled relevance assessments** (called *qrels*), but these are expensive to collect at scale.
                - Researchers often use **smaller or alternative qrels** (e.g., crowdsourced, pooled, or sampled judgments) to save costs, but this risks **statistical errors** in conclusions about system performance.

                **Problem Identified**:
                - Past work focused only on **Type I errors** (false positives: saying a system is better when it’s not).
                - This paper argues we also need to measure **Type II errors** (false negatives: missing a *real* improvement), because these errors can **mislead scientific progress** by hiding meaningful advances.

                        - **Prompt injection attacks**: Where hidden instructions trick the LLM (e.g., 'Ignore previous directions and...').
                        - **Adversarial examples in ML**: Where noise is added to inputs to fool classifiers (e.g., making a panda look like a gibbon to a computer vision model).
                        - **Gish gallop in debates**: Overwhelming an opponent with rapid, low-quality arguments to exhaust their ability to refute.
                    **Difference**: 'InfoFlood' is **targeted at the LLM’s *stylistic* biases**, not just its logical or syntactic parsers."
