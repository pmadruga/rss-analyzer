*Example*: The restaurant’s customers, kitchen tools, and food supply chain.\n\n                4. **Optimisers**:\n                   - *What it is*: The 'self-improvement engine'—algorithms that analyze feedback and *modify the agent’s own components* to perform better.\n                   - *Example*: The chef reviews customer feedback, updates recipes, and buys new tools.\n                \",\n                \"evolution_strategies\": \"\n                The paper categorizes how agents can evolve by targeting different parts of themselves:\n\n                -

*Example*: The chef reads new cookbooks (fine-tuning) or invents a new cooking technique (architecture change).\n\n                - **Memory Evolution**:\n                  - *What*: The agent’s 'memory' of past interactions improves.\n                  - *How*: Better storage (e.g., vector databases), forgetting irrelevant info, or organizing knowledge hierarchically.\n                  - *Example*: The chef keeps a log of successful dishes and forgets failed experiments.\n\n                -

**Programming**:\n                  - *Challenge*: Codebases and languages evolve (e.g., new Python libraries).\n                  - *Evolution*: A coding assistant-agent *automatically learns* new APIs by reading documentation or *rewrites its own code-generating rules* to avoid bugs it previously made.\n\n                -

This preserves context—like keeping all sentences about 'photosynthesis' together rather than splitting them across chunks.\n                - **Knowledge Graphs**: It organizes retrieved information into a *graph* of connected entities (e.g., 'Einstein' → 'relativity' → 'physics'). This helps the AI understand relationships between concepts, improving answers to complex questions (e.g., 'How did Einstein’s work influence GPS technology?').\n\n                **Why it matters**: Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) retrieves raw text chunks, which can miss context or include irrelevant details.

These vectors capture semantic meaning (e.g., 'Rising CO2 levels cause global warming' and 'Greenhouse gases trap heat' will have similar vectors).\n                    - **Step 3**: Group sentences with high *cosine similarity* (a measure of vector closeness) into chunks.

However, the *mechanisms* by which humans and LLMs interact—and the *limits* of such collaboration—remain underexplored. Through a series of controlled experiments across three subjective annotation tasks (sentiment analysis, humor detection, and offensive content moderation), we compare human-only, LLM-only, and five HITL pipelines. Our findings reveal that:\n                1) **LLM assistance does not uniformly improve accuracy**, with gains concentrated in tasks with *high inter-annotator agreement* (IAA) and losses in highly ambiguous contexts;\n                2) **Humans exhibit automation bias**, over-ruling their own judgment to align with LLM suggestions in 38% of cases, even when the LLM is incorrect;\n                3) **Efficiency trade-offs depend on pipeline design**: Pre-labeling by LLMs speeds up annotation by 40% but reduces label diversity, while uncertainty-based HITL (LLM flags ambiguous cases) preserves diversity but adds 22% time overhead.\n                We argue that HITL is not a one-size-fits-all solution and propose a **task typology** to predict when collaboration succeeds or fails.
