A new algorithm called **Semantic-based Concept Retrieval using Group Steiner Tree (GST)** that weaves domain-specific knowledge into semantic search.\n                2.

The key finding is surprising: **these sophisticated models often fail when the query and answer share few *exact words* (lexical overlap), sometimes performing worse than a simple 20-year-old keyword-matching tool (BM25)**.\n\n                **Analogy**:\n                Imagine hiring a literary critic (LM re-ranker) to judge which book best answers your question. You’d expect them to grasp nuanced themes and connections. But the study finds that if the book doesn’t repeat your exact keywords, the critic might dismiss it—even if it’s the *semantically* perfect answer.

If the library’s catalog (knowledge graph) is organized by *region* (e.g., 'Latin America > Agriculture'), the librarian’s search strategy (SPARQL query) will differ than if it’s organized by *topic* (e.g., 'Climate Change > Crops').

The key challenge is that human-labeled relevance data (e.g., 'this document is relevant to query X') is **expensive to collect**, so researchers often use **cheaper, approximate methods** (e.g., crowdsourcing, pooling, or automated labeling). But if these approximate qrels are flawed, they might lead to **wrong conclusions** about which system is better.\n\n                The paper focuses on **two types of statistical errors** in hypothesis testing when comparing IR systems:\n                - **Type I errors (false positives)**: Saying System A is better than System B when it’s *not* (e.g., due to noisy qrels).\n                - **Type II errors (false negatives)**: Saying there’s *no difference* between systems when there *is* one (e.g., missing a real improvement because the qrels are too sparse).\n\n                Previous work mostly ignored **Type II errors**, but the authors argue these are just as harmful—they can **stifle progress** by hiding real advancements in IR systems.
