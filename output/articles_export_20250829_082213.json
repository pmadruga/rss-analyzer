Garbage in = garbage out.\n\n                2. **Agent System**:\n                   - *What it is*: The ‘brain’ of the agent—its current skills, knowledge, and decision-making rules (e.g., a large language model + tools like web search or code execution).\n                   - *Why it matters*: This is what *gets evolved*. If the agent is a chef, this is its recipe book—it starts with basic recipes but adds new ones over time.\n\n                3. **Environment**:\n                   - *What it is*: The ‘world’ the agent operates in (e.g., a stock market for a trading bot, a hospital for a medical AI, or a user’s phone for a virtual assistant).\n                   - *Why it matters*: The environment gives *feedback*—like a teacher grading homework. If the agent’s actions fail (e.g., a trade loses money), the environment ‘tells’ it indirectly.\n\n                4. **Optimisers**:\n                   - *What it is*: The ‘evolution engine’—algorithms that *automatically adjust* the agent’s brain based on feedback. This could be:\n                     - Reinforcement learning (trial-and-error rewards).\n                     - Genetic algorithms (mixing and mutating ‘good’ agent versions).\n                     - Human feedback (e.g., users rating the agent’s responses).\n                   - *Why it matters*: Without this, the agent can’t improve.

This makes them poor at *embedding tasks* (e.g., search, clustering, retrieval), where understanding context *bidirectionally* (like BERT does) is critical. Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask (breaking pretrained behavior), or\n                - Add extra input text (increasing cost).\n\n                **Solution**: *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny BERT-style module to pre-process input text into a single *Contextual token*. This token is prepended to the LLM’s input, giving it bidirectional context *without* changing the LLM’s architecture or adding heavy computation. The final embedding combines this Contextual token with the traditional last-token (EOS) output to reduce 'recency bias' (where the LLM overweights the end of the text).\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine reading a book with a blindfold that only lets you see words *before* the current one.
