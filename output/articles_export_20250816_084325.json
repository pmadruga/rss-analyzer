Today’s AI agents (e.g., chatbots or task-automation tools) are usually *static*: they’re trained once and then deployed, but they can’t adapt if their environment changes (e.g., new user needs, unexpected problems). This survey explores how to build agents that *evolve* by learning from their own experiences, feedback, and mistakes, blending the power of **foundation models** (like LLMs) with **lifelong learning** (like how humans adapt over time).\n\n                **Key analogy**: Think of it like a video game character that starts with basic skills (foundation model) but levels up by fighting monsters (real-world tasks), collecting loot (feedback/data), and upgrading its gear (self-improving its components) without the player (human developer) intervening.\n                \",\n                \"why_it_matters\": \"\n                - **Static AI fails in dynamic worlds**: Current agents (e.g., customer service bots) break when faced with new scenarios (e.g., a pandemic changing user queries).\n                - **Human effort is a bottleneck**: Today, improving agents requires manual tweaking by engineers. Self-evolving agents could reduce this dependency.\n                - **Lifelong learning**: Humans don’t relearn everything from scratch for every new task; neither should AI.\n                \"\n            },\n\n            \"2_key_components_teardown\": {\n                \"unified_framework\": {\n                    \"description\": \"\n                    The authors propose a **feedback loop framework** to standardize how self-evolving agents work.
