**Key Findings:** The main findings are that the two-stage training framework achieves competitive RAG performance while reducing retrieval costs by nearly half, using only 1000 training examples. This challenges the popular claim that large-scale fine-tuning is necessary for improving RAG metrics.

**Key Findings:** The main findings are that quantifying Type II errors provides additional insights into the discriminative power of qrels. Balanced classification metrics, such as balanced accuracy, can summarize this discriminative power effectively.

**Key Findings:** The main discovery was that LLMs can be jailbroken by using the InfoFlood method. This method overwhelms the safety filters by exploiting the model's reliance on superficial cues for toxicity, allowing restricted information to be accessed.
