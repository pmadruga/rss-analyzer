These satellites collect *many types of data*:\n            - **Optical images** (like photos, but with extra color bands like infrared),\n            - **Radar data** (which works day/night, even through clouds),\n            - **Elevation maps** (3D terrain),\n            - **Weather data** (temperature, precipitation),\n            - **Pseudo-labels** (noisy or approximate labels, e.g., from weak supervision).\n            Each of these data types is useful for tasks like tracking crops, detecting floods, or monitoring deforestation. But they’re all *different*—like trying to read a book, a map, and a weather report at the same time.\n\n            **The Problem:**\n            - **Scale variability**: A boat might be just 1–2 pixels in an image, while a glacier spans thousands of pixels. A flood might change in hours; a forest grows over decades.\n            - **Modalities don’t mix easily**: Optical and radar data are like apples and oranges—how do you combine them meaningfully?\n            - **Specialized models**: Today, we train separate AI models for each task (e.g., one for crop mapping, another for flood detection). This is inefficient and doesn’t leverage shared patterns across tasks.\n\n            **The Solution (Galileo):**\n            The authors built a *single* AI model (a transformer) that:\n            1. **Handles all modalities at once**—it fuses optical, radar, elevation, etc., into one unified representation.\n            2. **Learns at multiple scales**—it captures both tiny details (e.g., a boat) and huge patterns (e.g., a glacier) *simultaneously*.\n            3. **Uses self-supervised learning**: Instead of requiring labeled data (which is scarce for remote sensing), it learns by *masking* parts of the input and predicting them (like filling in missing puzzle pieces). It has two key tricks:\n               - **Global contrastive loss**: Compares deep features of masked vs. unmasked patches to learn high-level patterns.\n               - **Local contrastive loss**: Compares raw input projections to preserve low-level details (e.g., textures).\n            4. **Generalist model**: One model for *many tasks*—crop mapping, flood detection, land cover classification, etc.—outperforming specialized models trained for each task individually.\n\n            **Why it matters:**\n            - **Efficiency**: Train one model instead of dozens.\n            - **Performance**: Beats state-of-the-art (SoTA) specialist models on 11 benchmarks.\n            - **Scalability**: Can incorporate *new modalities* (e.g., adding air quality data later) without retraining from scratch.\n            \",\n            \"analogy\": \"\n            Think of Galileo like a **universal translator for Earth observation**:\n            -

This makes them poor at *bidirectional* tasks like semantic search or text embeddings, where understanding context from *both* directions matters. Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask entirely (losing pretrained unidirectional strengths), or\n                - Add extra input text (increasing compute costs).\n\n                **Solution (Causal2Vec)**: Instead of hacking the LLM itself, we *pre-process* the input text with a tiny BERT-style model to distill it into a single **Contextual token**. This token is prepended to the LLM’s input, giving *every* token in the LLM access to *bidirectional context* without breaking its causal architecture. Then, we combine the hidden states of this Contextual token + the EOS token to create the final embedding, reducing recency bias (where the LLM overweights the last few tokens).\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine reading a book with a flashlight that only lights up the current page and past pages (causal LLM).
