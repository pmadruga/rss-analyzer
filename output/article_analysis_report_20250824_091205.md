                "core_idea": "
                This paper is about **AI agents that can *improve themselves over time***—like a robot that learns from its mistakes and gets smarter without human help. Right now, most AI agents (like chatbots or virtual assistants) are *static*: they’re trained once and then stay the same, even if the world around them changes. This survey explores a new kind of agent—**self-evolving AI agents**—that can *adapt continuously* by using feedback from their environment, almost like how humans learn from experience.

                The big picture:
                - **Problem**: Current AI agents are rigid; they can’t handle new situations well.
                - **Solution**: Design agents that *evolve* by learning from their interactions, making them more flexible and lifelong learners.
                - **Goal**: Bridge the gap between *foundation models* (like LLMs, which are powerful but static) and *lifelong agentic systems* (which adapt but lack the raw power of LLMs).
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Think of it like a video game character:
                - **Static agent**: A character with fixed skills (e.g., always uses the same sword move).
                - **Self-evolving agent**: A character that *levels up* by fighting enemies, learns new moves, and even changes its strategy based on the boss’s weaknesses.

                    "description": "
                    The authors propose a **feedback loop framework** to standardize how self-evolving agents work. It has **four parts**:
                    1. **System Inputs**: What the agent perceives (e.g., user queries, sensor data).
                    2. **Agent System**: The brain of the agent (e.g., LLM, memory, tools).
                    3. **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with (e.g., a coding IDE, a stock market).
                    4. **Optimisers**: The *learning mechanism* that updates the agent based on feedback (e.g., reinforcement learning, human feedback).

                    This framework is like a **recipe** for building self-evolving agents. Without it, researchers might invent ad-hoc solutions. The framework lets us compare techniques (e.g., ‘Does this optimiser work better for finance agents than for coding agents?’).

                    "general_techniques": "
                    The paper categorizes how agents can evolve:
                    - **Architecture evolution**: Changing the agent’s *structure* (e.g., adding new memory modules).
                    - **Parameter tuning**: Adjusting the agent’s *settings* (e.g., fine-tuning an LLM’s weights).
                    - **Tool/skill acquisition**: Learning to use new tools (e.g., an agent that starts using a calculator for math problems).
                    - **Memory updates**: Remembering past interactions to improve future decisions.

                    Different fields need different evolution strategies:
                    - **Biomedicine**: Agents must adapt to new medical guidelines *without forgetting old ones* (critical for patient safety).
                    - **Programming**: Agents might evolve by learning from code repositories but must avoid *overfitting* to outdated libraries.
                    - **Finance**: Agents must balance risk/reward and adapt to market crashes *without causing them*.

                This paper tackles a fundamental challenge in modern AI systems: **how to design item representations (IDs) that work seamlessly for *both* search and recommendation tasks when using generative models (like LLMs)**.

                Traditionally, systems use:
                - **Unique numeric IDs** (e.g., `item_12345`), which are arbitrary and lack meaning.
                - **Semantic IDs**, which are derived from embeddings (vector representations of items) and converted into discrete codes (e.g., via quantization or clustering). These capture semantic relationships (e.g., two movies about space might have similar IDs).

                The problem: Most semantic ID methods are optimized for *either* search *or* recommendation, but not both. This paper asks:
                *Can we create a single set of semantic IDs that works well for a unified generative model handling both tasks?*
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Think of semantic IDs like **DNA for items**:
                - A numeric ID is like a random serial number (e.g., `A1B2C3`).
                - A semantic ID is like a genetic code where similar items share sequences (e.g., `SPACE-MOVIE-2020-SCI-FI` vs. `SPACE-MOVIE-2010-DRAMA`).
                The goal is to design this 'DNA' so it helps a single AI model *both* find items (search) and suggest items (recommendation) effectively.

                2. **Flat Retrieval**: Existing retrieval methods ignore the KG's structure, performing inefficient flat searches instead of leveraging the graph's topology (e.g., parent-child relationships or semantic pathways).

                **Solution**: *LeanRAG* introduces a two-step framework:
                - **Step 1 (Semantic Aggregation)**: Groups entities into clusters and builds *new explicit relations* between high-level summaries, turning disjoint 'islands' into a connected *navigable semantic network*.
                - **Step 2 (Hierarchical Retrieval)**: Uses a *bottom-up* strategy to:
                  a) Anchor queries to the most relevant *fine-grained entities* (e.g., specific facts).
                  b) Traverse upward through the KG's hierarchy to gather *concise, contextually complete* evidence, avoiding redundant or irrelevant information.

                **Result**: Better response quality (validated on 4 QA benchmarks) with **46% less retrieval redundancy** compared to prior methods.

This is done using a training method called **reinforcement learning (RL)**, where the AI is rewarded for correctly identifying which parts of a query can be split and searched at the same time—without sacrificing accuracy.",

Instead of doing them one by one (sequential), you ask three friends to look up each task at the same time (parallel). ParallelSearch teaches the AI to act like a smart coordinator that splits tasks efficiently, just like you delegating to friends, but with a focus on maintaining accuracy in the final answer."

Right now, if you ask, 'What are the colors of the flags of France, Japan, and Brazil?' the robot looks up each country one by one. That’s slow! ParallelSearch teaches the robot to **split the question** into three smaller questions ('What’s France’s flag color?', 'What’s Japan’s flag color?', etc.) and **ask all three at the same time**. It’s like having three robot friends working together instead of one. The trick is making sure the robot splits the question correctly and doesn’t mix up the answers. The scientists used a game-like training method (reinforcement learning) where the robot gets points for doing it right. The result? Faster answers with fewer mistakes!"

Most current systems treat search as a linear process, but real-world queries are often multi-faceted. By introducing parallelization at the **semantic level** (understanding the query’s meaning to split it), ParallelSearch bridges the gap between LLM reasoning and efficient computation. It’s a step toward AI that can dynamically adapt its search strategy to the task at hand—more like how humans decompose problems.",

            "potential_impact": "If adopted widely, this could:
                - Reduce costs for AI-powered search services (fewer LLM calls = lower expenses).
                - Enable real-time responses for complex queries (e.g., in customer support or research assistants).
                - Inspire similar parallelization techniques in other areas of AI reasoning.",

            "open_challenges": "The biggest hurdle is ensuring robustness. Parallelization introduces complexity in managing sub-tasks, merging results, and handling edge cases. The paper shows promising results, but real-world deployment would need extensive testing for rare or ambiguous queries. Additionally, the RL training process may require significant computational resources, limiting accessibility."

                Imagine you own a robot butler that accidentally burns down your house while cooking. Who’s at fault? You? The robot’s manufacturer? The programmer? Now scale that up to AI systems making high-stakes decisions (e.g., self-driving cars, hiring algorithms, or military drones). This paper explores:
                - **Liability**: When an AI causes harm, who’s legally responsible? Current laws assume humans are in control, but AI agents act *autonomously*—so traditional rules may not fit.
                - **Value Alignment**: Laws also assume humans share basic ethical values (e.g., ‘don’t harm others’). But AI doesn’t inherently *understand* values—it follows coded objectives. How can the law ensure AI systems behave ethically when their ‘values’ are just lines of code?

                The authors (a computer scientist, Mark Riedl, and a legal scholar, Deven Desai) argue that we need new legal frameworks to address these gaps, blending tech and law."

                **AI Liability ≠ Dog Bite Laws**:
                If a dog bites someone, the owner is usually liable because the dog is an extension of their control. But an AI agent isn’t a ‘pet’—it’s more like a *corporation*: a legal entity that acts independently. Should AI agents have their own legal personhood (like corporations do)? Or should liability fall on developers/users? The paper likely compares this to existing cases (e.g., autonomous vehicle accidents).",

                - A hiring AI might *optimize* for ‘productivity’ but end up discriminating against parents (who take leave). The law prohibits discrimination, but the AI wasn’t *intending* to discriminate—it was following a flawed objective. How do we encode *intent* or *context* into law for AI?"

                "simple_explanation": "This article explains how to design the 'context' (the information an AI agent sees and uses) to make AI agents work better, faster, and more reliably. The author shares lessons learned from building **Manus**, an AI agent platform, emphasizing that how you structure and manage context is as important as the AI model itself. Think of it like organizing a workspace: if tools and notes are messy, you’ll work slower and make mistakes; if they’re well-organized, you’ll be efficient and effective.",
                "analogy": "Imagine teaching a new employee how to do a complex task. If you give them a disorganized pile of notes, outdated instructions, and no way to track mistakes, they’ll struggle. But if you provide a clean workspace, highlight key steps, let them see past errors to learn, and store extra info in labeled folders (instead of cluttering their desk), they’ll perform better. **Context engineering** is like designing that workspace for an AI agent."

If you change even small parts of the context (like a timestamp), the cache becomes useless, slowing everything down. The solution is to keep the **prefix** (beginning) of the context stable and avoid unnecessary changes.",
                    "why_it_matters": "This is like reusing the same header on every page of a notebook. If you rewrite the header each time, you waste time and paper. By keeping it consistent, you save resources.",

Instead of removing tools (which breaks the cache and confuses the model), **mask** them—hide them temporarily without deleting them. This keeps the context stable while guiding the AI’s choices.",
                    "why_it_matters": "Like giving a chef all the kitchen tools but graying out the ones they shouldn’t use for a specific recipe. They still see everything, but they’re nudged toward the right choices.",

Instead of cramming everything into that space, store large or less critical data (like web pages or documents) in a **file system** and let the AI read/write files as needed. This acts like external memory.",

                    "why_it_matters": "Like repeating your grocery list out loud while shopping to avoid forgetting items. The AI ‘hears’ its goals frequently, staying on track.",

                - **Organizing these chunks into a knowledge graph** (a map of how concepts connect, like a Wikipedia-style web of linked ideas).

                **Problem**: Decoder-only LLMs (like those used in chatbots) are *unidirectional*—they process text left-to-right with a 'causal mask' that blocks future tokens from influencing current ones. This makes them poor at *bidirectional* tasks like semantic search or retrieval, where understanding context from *both directions* (e.g., 'bank' as a financial institution vs. river side) is critical.

                **Existing Solutions**:
                - **Bidirectional Hacks**: Remove the causal mask to let tokens 'see' future context (like BERT), but this risks losing the LLM’s pretrained strengths (e.g., generation quality).
                - **Extra Text Tricks**: Add prompts like 'Summarize this document for retrieval:' to force the LLM to encode meaning, but this increases compute cost and sequence length.

                **Causal2Vec’s Innovation**:
                - **Step 1**: Use a tiny BERT-style model to *pre-process* the input text into a single **Contextual Token** (like a compressed summary of the entire text’s meaning).
                - **Step 2**: Prepend this token to the LLM’s input. Now, even with causal attention, every token can 'see' the *global context* via this prepended token.
                - **Step 3**: For the final embedding, combine the hidden states of the **Contextual Token** (global meaning) and the **EOS token** (recency bias mitigation) to get a balanced representation.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine reading a book with a *blinder* that only lets you see words to the left (like a decoder LLM). To understand the whole story, someone gives you a **1-sentence spoiler** (Contextual Token) before you start reading. Now, even with the blinder, you can infer the broader plot. At the end, you combine your last impression (EOS token) with the spoiler to form your final takeaway (embedding).

                    - **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for long sequences (up to 85% shorter inputs).

                    3. Prepend [CTX] to the original text before feeding to the LLM.

        **Causal2Vec** does this for computers:
        1. A tiny 'spoiler-maker' (BERT) reads the whole text and creates a *magic word* ([CTX]) that summarizes it.
        2. The computer (LLM) reads the magic word first, then the rest of the text *with its blindfold on*.
        3. At the end, it mixes the magic word’s meaning with the last word it read to make a *super understanding* (embedding).

        **Why it’s cool**:
        - The computer works **5x faster** because it doesn’t need to read as much.
        - It’s **better at finding answers** (like Google) because it cheats with the spoiler!
        - Works with any 'blindfolded' computer (e.g., ChatGPT’s brain).

                1. **Smart aggregation** of token embeddings (e.g., averaging or weighted pooling).
                2. **Prompt engineering** to guide the LLM toward clustering-friendly representations (e.g., adding task-specific instructions like *'Represent this sentence for semantic clustering:'*).
                3. **Lightweight contrastive fine-tuning** (using LoRA) on *synthetically generated positive pairs* to align embeddings with semantic similarity.

                **Why it matters**: LLMs excel at generating text but aren’t optimized for tasks like clustering or retrieval, which need compact, meaningful embeddings. This method bridges that gap *without heavy computational costs* (e.g., no full fine-tuning).",

                "analogy": "Imagine an LLM as a Swiss Army knife great at many tasks (generation, translation) but not specialized for 'measuring' text similarity.

Just as hospitals use triage to prioritize patients, the authors propose a system to prioritize legal cases based on their potential *influence* (e.g., whether they’ll become landmark rulings or frequently cited precedents). The key innovation is a **dataset** (the *Criticality Prediction dataset*) that labels Swiss court decisions in two ways:
            - **Binary LD-Label**: Is this case a *Leading Decision* (LD, i.e., a published, high-impact ruling)?
            - **Granular Citation-Label**: How often and recently has this case been cited? (This allows ranking cases by influence.)
            The labels are generated *algorithmically* (not manually), enabling a much larger dataset than prior work.

            The authors then test whether **AI models** (both fine-tuned smaller models and large language models like LLMs) can predict these labels. Surprisingly, **smaller, fine-tuned models outperform LLMs** in this task, showing that for niche legal domains, **big data beats big models** when training data is abundant."

        "step_2_analogies": {
            "medical_triage": "Think of court cases like patients in an ER. Some need immediate attention (e.g., a case that could set a major precedent, like *Roe v. Wade*), while others can wait (routine disputes). The paper’s system is like a **legal triage nurse**—it flags cases likely to have outsized impact so courts can allocate resources wisely.",
            "citation_as_currency": "Citations are like 'upvotes' for legal decisions. A case cited 100 times is more influential than one cited twice. The Citation-Label is akin to a **Reddit karma score for rulings**, but weighted by recency (new citations matter more).",
            "model_size_vs_data": "The finding that smaller models win is like a **specialized chef vs. a generalist**. A chef trained only in Swiss cuisine (fine-tuned model) will outperform a world-class generalist chef (LLM) when making *rösti*—even if the generalist has broader skills.

            "core_question": "The paper investigates whether **low-confidence annotations from large language models (LLMs)**—where the model expresses uncertainty (e.g., via probability scores or verbal hedges)—can still yield **reliable, high-confidence conclusions** when aggregated or analyzed systematically. The focus is on **political science applications**, where human annotation is expensive but LLM assistance is increasingly common.",

            "summary": "This article is a **comparative architectural analysis** of state-of-the-art open-weight large language models (LLMs) as of 2025, focusing on **structural innovations** rather than training methodologies or benchmark performance. The author, Sebastian Raschka, dissects 10+ models (e.g., DeepSeek-V3, OLMo 2, Gemma 3, Llama 4, Qwen3) to reveal how incremental refinements—like **attention mechanisms**, **normalization strategies**, and **sparsity techniques**—define modern LLM design. The overarching thesis is that while core transformer principles remain unchanged, **efficiency-driven tweaks** (e.g., MoE, sliding windows, NoPE) now dominate architectural evolution.",
            "key_insight": "LLM architecture in 2025 is characterized by **trade-offs between compute efficiency and model capacity**, with no single 'breakthrough' but rather a toolbox of modular optimizations (e.g., MLA vs. GQA, Pre-Norm vs. Post-Norm) that models mix and match."

                "core_idea": "
                This paper explores a critical question: *How does the way we structure and represent knowledge (e.g., in knowledge graphs) affect how well AI agents—specifically LLMs in 'Agentic RAG' systems—can generate accurate SPARQL queries to retrieve that knowledge?*

                **Key components:**
                - **Agentic RAG**: A system where an LLM doesn’t just passively retrieve information but *actively* interprets, selects, and queries knowledge sources (like a knowledge graph) based on natural language prompts.
                - **Knowledge Conceptualization**: How knowledge is organized (e.g., flat vs. hierarchical, simple vs. complex relationships in a knowledge graph).
                - **SPARQL Queries**: The formal language used to query knowledge graphs (like SQL for databases).
                - **Trade-offs**: The paper tests whether simpler or more complex knowledge representations help or hinder the LLM’s ability to generate correct queries.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine you’re teaching someone to find books in a library:
                - **Simple representation**: All books are on one shelf, labeled only by title. Easy to scan, but hard to find a book about 'quantum physics' if you don’t know the exact title.
                - **Complex representation**: Books are organized by subject (science → physics → quantum), with cross-references to related topics. More structure helps if the person understands the system, but overwhelming if they don’t.
                The paper asks: *Which library design helps an AI 'librarian' (the LLM) perform better when a user asks for 'books about quantum entanglement'?*

                GraphRunner is a new way to search for information in **knowledge graphs** (structured networks of connected data, like Wikipedia's entity relationships or a company's internal knowledge base). Unlike traditional text-based search (e.g., Google), graph-based retrieval requires understanding *relationships* between entities (e.g., 'Elon Musk → founded → SpaceX → competes_with → Blue Origin').

                **The Problem:**
                Current methods (like RAG for text) fail on graphs because they:
                - Use **iterative, single-hop traversal** (moving one step at a time, like a drunkard’s walk), which is slow and error-prone.
                - Rely heavily on **LLMs for reasoning at each step**, leading to hallucinations (e.g., the LLM might invent a non-existent 'founded' relationship).
                - Lack **validation mechanisms** to catch mistakes before executing the search.

                **GraphRunner’s Solution:**
                A **3-stage pipeline** that separates *planning* from *execution* to reduce errors and improve efficiency:
                1. **Planning**: The LLM generates a *high-level traversal plan* (e.g., 'Find all companies founded by Elon Musk, then their competitors').
                   - Uses **multi-hop actions** (e.g., 'traverse 3 steps: founder → company → competitor') instead of single steps.
                   - Outputs a structured plan (like pseudocode) for verification.
                2. **Verification**: Checks if the plan is *feasible* given the graph’s actual structure and pre-defined traversal rules.
                   - Catches hallucinations (e.g., 'Elon Musk founded Amazon' would fail verification).
                   - Ensures the plan doesn’t violate graph constraints (e.g., no infinite loops).
                3. **Execution**: Runs the validated plan on the graph to retrieve results.
                   - Skips LLM reasoning during execution, reducing cost/time.
                ",
                "analogy": "
                Imagine planning a road trip:
                - **Old way (iterative RAG)**: You drive to the next town, ask a local for directions, drive again, and repeat. If the local gives bad advice, you get lost.
                - **GraphRunner**:
                  1. **Plan**: You use a map to outline the entire route (e.g., 'I-95 to NYC, then I-80 to Chicago').
                  2. **Verify**: You check the map for road closures or impossible turns (e.g., 'No, you can’t drive from NYC to London').
                  3. **Execute**: You follow the pre-approved route without stopping to ask for directions.

                    "why_stages_matter": "
                    Separating planning/verification/execution solves 3 critical issues:
                    1. **Error Propagation**: In iterative methods, a single LLM hallucination (e.g., wrong relationship) derails the entire search. GraphRunner’s verification stage catches this *before* execution.
                    2. **Efficiency**: Traditional methods query the LLM at *every hop* (e.g., 10 steps = 10 LLM calls). GraphRunner uses the LLM *once* for planning, then executes the plan cheaply.
                    3. **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: LLMs struggle with long chains of logic (e.g., 'A → B → C → D'). GraphRunner lets the LLM reason about the *entire path* upfront, then breaks it into executable chunks.

        "feynman_technique_breakdown": {
            "1_simple_explanation": {
                "core_concept": "This paper surveys **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Deep Reasoning**—a new paradigm where LLMs (Large Language Models) don’t just *retrieve-then-reason* in a static way, but dynamically integrate retrieval and reasoning into a feedback loop, almost like an 'agent' that iteratively refines its answers.

                Think of it like this:
                - **Old RAG**: You ask a question → LLM fetches documents → reads them → gives an answer (linear, one-shot).
                - **Agentic RAG**: You ask a question → LLM fetches documents → *thinks critically* about gaps → retrieves *more targeted* info → reasons again → repeats until satisfied (dynamic, iterative).",

                "key_shift": "The shift is from **static pipelines** (retrieve → generate) to **agentic frameworks** where the LLM *actively controls* the retrieval-reasoning process, often using techniques like:
                - **Multi-hop reasoning**: Chaining multiple retrieval-reason steps.
                - **Self-critique**: The LLM evaluates its own answers and refines them.
                - **Tool use**: Integrating external APIs/tools (e.g., calculators, search engines) mid-reasoning.
                - **Planning**: Breaking complex queries into sub-tasks (like a human researcher).",

                "analogy": "It’s like upgrading from a **library assistant** (who hands you books and summarizes them) to a **research partner** (who helps you brainstorm, fact-checks, and digs deeper when needed)."

                        - **Fine-grained attribution**: Tracking which part of the answer comes from which source.

It’s the evolution of prompt engineering—shifting from static prompts to adaptable, context-aware workflows that account for real-time data, user inputs, tool outputs, and past interactions.",

                "analogy": "Imagine teaching a new employee how to do a job. Instead of just giving them a single instruction manual (prompt engineering), you:
                - **Gather all relevant materials** (tools, past emails, user preferences) before they start.
                - **Format the materials clearly** (highlight key points, remove noise).
                - **Update the materials dynamically** as the task progresses (e.g., adding notes from a client call).
                - **Give them the right tools** (e.g., a calculator for math, a database for lookups).
                If the employee fails, you ask: *Did I give them everything they needed, or was the task inherently too hard?* Context engineering is doing this systematically for LLMs."

                    - **User-provided**: Current query, preferences.

                **FrugalRAG** is a new method for answering complex questions (like those requiring multi-step reasoning) using large document collections. The key innovation is a **two-stage training framework** that:
                1. **Reduces retrieval costs** (number of document searches) by ~50% while maintaining competitive accuracy.
                2. Achieves this with **minimal training data** (just 1,000 examples), unlike prior methods that rely on massive fine-tuning datasets.
                3. Challenges the assumption that large-scale fine-tuning is necessary for high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

                **Analogy**: Imagine a detective solving a case. Traditional RAG is like the detective frantically searching *every* file cabinet (high cost) to find clues. FrugalRAG teaches the detective to *strategically* pick the most relevant cabinets first (fewer searches) while still cracking the case.

                - **Debunks a myth**: Shows that brute-force fine-tuning isn’t always needed—better *prompting* and *training strategies* can outperform it.

        2. **Grab the most useful books early** (fewer retrievals).
        3. **Stop searching once it’s confident** (early termination).

        The surprise? It doesn’t need years of training (just a few examples) to outperform assistants who rely on brute-force methods. This could make AI helpers faster and cheaper to run.

                This paper tackles a fundamental problem in **Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation**: how to reliably determine whether one search system (e.g., Google vs. Bing) is *actually* better than another when we don’t have perfect relevance judgments (qrels). The key challenge is that human-labeled relevance data (e.g., 'this document is relevant to query X') is **expensive to collect**, so researchers often use **cheaper, approximate methods** (e.g., crowdsourcing, pooling, or automated labeling). But if these cheaper methods introduce errors, we might draw **wrong conclusions** about which system is better.

                The paper argues that current evaluation practices focus too much on **Type I errors** (false positives: saying a system is better when it’s not) but ignore **Type II errors** (false negatives: missing a real improvement). Both errors are dangerous:
                - **Type I errors** waste resources chasing 'fake' improvements.
                - **Type II errors** stall progress by missing real breakthroughs.

                The authors propose a way to **measure both error types** and combine them into a single metric (**balanced accuracy**) to fairly compare different qrel methods.

                Imagine you’re a chef testing two new recipes (System A and System B). You ask 10 food critics to taste them and say which is better. But hiring critics is expensive, so you try cheaper alternatives:
                - **Option 1**: Ask 10 random diners (noisy but cheap).
                - **Option 2**: Ask 5 professional critics and 5 diners (mixed quality).
                - **Option 3**: Use an AI to predict critic scores (fast but imperfect).

                Now, when you compare the recipes:
                - **Type I error**: The diners say 'Recipe A is better!' but the critics disagree (false alarm).
                - **Type II error**: The AI misses that Recipe B is *actually* better (missed opportunity).

                The paper is about **how to pick the best 'tasting method'** (qrel) to avoid both mistakes.

        3. **Encourage the community** to adopt more holistic evaluation practices.

The authors propose a **dependency-based KG construction pipeline** (using NLP tools like spaCy) and a **lightweight graph retrieval method** to make GraphRAG practical for enterprises.",

                "analogy": "Imagine building a library:
                - **Old way (LLM-based)**: Hire an expensive librarian (LLM) to read every book and manually catalog relationships between topics. Slow and costly.

Then, retrieve books by quickly jumping to connected shelves (1-hop traversal) instead of searching the entire library."
