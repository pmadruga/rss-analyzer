#### Methodology

Imagine you're trying to teach a robot to understand something subjective, like whether a painting is beautiful. The robot can learn a lot from data, but it might still struggle because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So, you decide to put a human in the loop to help the robot learn better. This is the core idea behind our research.

Our methodology starts with a fundamental problem: How can we improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks that are subjective, like sentiment analysis or artistic critique? Here's how we approached it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Challenge**: LLMs are great at processing text, but they struggle with subjective tasks because these tasks often rely on human intuition and personal experience.

2. **Human-in-the-Loop Concept**: To tackle this, we introduced the idea of having a human assist the LLM. Think of it like a teacher helping a student understand a complex concept.

3. **Data Collection**: We gathered a dataset of subjective tasks, such as evaluating the sentiment of social media posts or judging the quality of creative writing.

4. **Annotation Process**: We had humans annotate this data, providing their subjective judgments. This is like having multiple art critics rate a painting.

5. **Model Training**: We then trained the LLM using these human-annotated examples. The model learns from the human judgments, improving its ability to handle subjective tasks.

6. **Evaluation**: Finally, we evaluated the LLM's performance on new, unseen data to see how well it had learned from the human annotations.

Each step was necessary to ensure that the LLM could benefit from human insight, making it better at understanding subjective information.

#### Key Findings

Our main discoveries were that putting a human in the loop significantly improves the LLM's performance on subjective tasks. Here's what we found and why it's important:

1. **Improved Accuracy**: The LLM's accuracy in tasks like sentiment analysis increased when it learned from human annotations. This is like the robot becoming better at understanding emotions in text.

2. **Better Generalization**: The LLM was able to generalize better to new, unseen data. This means the robot can apply what it learned to new situations, just like a student applying knowledge to new problems.

3. **Reduced Bias**: Human annotations helped reduce bias in the LLM's predictions. This is crucial because it makes the robot's judgments fairer and more reliable.

These findings are significant because they show that combining human intuition with machine learning can lead to better performance in tasks that are inherently subjective.

#### Technical Approach

Think of our technical approach like building a sophisticated tool to help the robot (LLM) learn from human teachers.

1. **LLM Basics**: At the core, LLMs are like advanced calculators that can process and generate text based on patterns they've learned from large amounts of data.

2. **Human Annotation Tool**: We created a tool that allows humans to annotate data. This tool is like a digital notebook where humans can write down their thoughts and judgments about the data.

3. **Integration**: We integrated this tool with the LLM, so the model could learn from the human annotations. Imagine the robot reading the notebook and learning from the teacher's notes.

4. **Training Algorithm**: We used a training algorithm that adjusts the LLM's parameters based on the human annotations. Think of this as the robot adjusting its understanding based on the teacher's feedback.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: We used metrics like accuracy and F1-score to evaluate the LLM's performance. These metrics are like report cards that tell us how well the robot is doing.

Our thought process was to create a system where the LLM could continuously learn from human feedback, improving its performance on subjective tasks over time.

#### Research Design

Our study was designed to answer the question: Can human-assisted annotation improve LLM performance in subjective tasks? Here's how we set it up:

1. **Hypothesis**: We hypothesized that human annotations would provide valuable insights that the LLM could learn from, improving its performance.

2. **Control Group**: We had a control group where the LLM was trained without human annotations. This is like having a class where the robot learns on its own.

3. **Experimental Group**: In the experimental group, the LLM was trained with human annotations. This is like having a class where the robot learns with the help of a teacher.

4. **Comparison**: We compared the performance of the LLM in both groups. This helps us understand the impact of human annotations.

5. **Statistical Analysis**: We used statistical tests to ensure that any improvements were significant and not just due to chance.

Each design choice was important for ensuring that our findings were robust and meaningful. By comparing the control and experimental groups, we could clearly see the benefit of human-assisted annotation.

#### Methodology

Imagine you're trying to solve a puzzle, but some of the pieces are a bit faded and hard to see. That's similar to the problem we're tackling in our research. We want to know if we can still make confident conclusions even when some of our data (annotations from Large Language Models, or LLMs) are not very confident.

Here's how we approached it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Problem**: We started by recognizing that LLMs often provide annotations with varying levels of confidence. Some annotations are very sure, while others are more like educated guesses.

2. **Collect Data**: We gathered a bunch of annotations from LLMs. Think of this as collecting all the puzzle pieces, even the faded ones.

3. **Analyze Confidence Levels**: We looked at how confident each annotation was. This is like checking how clear each puzzle piece is.

4. **Aggregate Annotations**: We combined these annotations to see if the overall picture became clearer. This is similar to putting the puzzle together and seeing if the faded pieces still help us see the whole image.

5. **Evaluate Conclusions**: Finally, we checked if the conclusions drawn from these aggregated annotations were reliable. This is like stepping back and seeing if the puzzle makes sense even with the faded pieces.

Each step was necessary to understand how unreliable pieces of information can still contribute to a reliable whole.

#### Key Findings

Our main discovery was that even when individual annotations from LLMs are not very confident, we can still draw reliable conclusions by aggregating them. This is significant because it means we don't need to discard uncertain data; it can still be useful.

Imagine you have a bunch of slightly blurry photos. Individually, they might not be clear, but when you put them all together, you can still make out the scene. That's what our findings show—even imperfect data can lead to confident conclusions.

This connects back to our original problem by demonstrating that we don't need to rely solely on highly confident annotations. We can use a broader range of data to make informed decisions.

#### Technical Approach

Think of our technical approach like building a house. Each part has a specific role and contributes to the overall structure.

1. **Data Collection**: We used APIs to gather annotations from LLMs. This is like gathering the materials needed to build the house.

2. **Confidence Scoring**: We implemented a confidence scoring mechanism. Imagine this as a tool that checks the quality of each material (annotation).

3. **Aggregation Algorithm**: We developed an algorithm to combine these annotations. Think of this as the blueprint that tells us how to put the materials together to build the house.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: We used statistical methods to evaluate the reliability of our conclusions. This is like having an inspector check if the house is sturdy and safe.

Our thought process was to ensure that each component worked together seamlessly. The data collection provided the raw materials, the confidence scoring ensured we knew the quality of each material, the aggregation algorithm told us how to use these materials effectively, and the evaluation metrics confirmed that our final structure (conclusions) was sound.

#### Research Design

Designing our study was like planning a journey. Each choice we made was crucial for reaching our destination—understanding if uncertain LLM annotations can lead to confident conclusions.

1. **Selection of LLMs**: We chose a diverse set of LLMs to ensure our findings were broadly applicable. This is like choosing different modes of transport to make sure our journey is versatile.

2. **Annotation Tasks**: We carefully selected the tasks for which the LLMs would provide annotations. Think of this as choosing the right paths to take on our journey.

3. **Confidence Thresholds**: We set varying confidence thresholds to see how different levels of uncertainty affected our conclusions. This is like setting checkpoints along our journey to see how well we're progressing.

4. **Control Group**: We included a control group of highly confident annotations to compare against our uncertain data. This is like having a map of a well-known route to compare with our new paths.

Each design choice was important because it helped us understand the impact of uncertainty in LLM annotations on the reliability of our conclusions.

#### Methodology

Imagine you're trying to build a highly intelligent robot that can learn from its environment and make decisions on its own. This is similar to what we're doing with Kimi K2, but in the digital world. Our core problem is creating an AI system that can understand and interact with complex data efficiently.

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need an AI that can handle large amounts of data and make smart decisions based on that data. Think of it like teaching a robot to sort through a massive library and find the most relevant books for any topic you give it.

2. **Literature Review**: We started by looking at what others have done. DeepSeek has some good work, but their papers often lack the depth we need. Moonshot AI's papers, on the other hand, are more detailed and give us a better roadmap.

3. **Develop MuonClip**: MuonClip is like the robot's eyes and ears. It helps the AI understand and process the data it receives. We developed MuonClip to be highly efficient and accurate, much like giving our robot super-sensitive sensors.

4. **Large-Scale Agentic Data Pipeline**: Think of this as the robot's brain and nervous system. It takes in data from MuonClip, processes it, and makes decisions. Building this pipeline involved creating a system that can handle vast amounts of data and make sense of it in real-time.

5. **Reinforcement Learning Framework**: This is like the robot's learning mechanism. It allows the AI to improve over time by learning from its mistakes and successes. We designed a framework that rewards the AI for good decisions and penalizes it for bad ones, helping it get smarter over time.

Each step was necessary to create a cohesive system that can learn and adapt, much like a highly intelligent robot.

#### Key Findings

Our main discoveries are:

1. **Efficient Data Processing**: We found that MuonClip significantly improves the efficiency of data processing. It can handle large datasets quickly and accurately, which is crucial for real-time applications.

2. **Scalable Data Pipeline**: Our large-scale agentic data pipeline can handle vast amounts of data without slowing down. This is important for applications that require real-time decision-making.

3. **Effective Learning**: Our reinforcement learning framework helps the AI learn and improve over time. This means the AI gets smarter the more it interacts with data, much like a human learning from experience.

These findings are significant because they address the core problem of creating an AI that can understand and interact with complex data efficiently. They show that our approach works and can be applied to real-world problems.

#### Technical Approach

Let's break down the technical components of Kimi K2 into simpler parts:

1. **MuonClip**: Imagine MuonClip as a highly advanced camera that not only captures images but also understands what it sees. Technically, it's a sophisticated data preprocessing tool that cleans, normalizes, and structures data so that the AI can understand it. We chose specific algorithms that are efficient and scalable, ensuring that MuonClip can handle large datasets without slowing down.

2. **Data Pipeline**: Think of the data pipeline as a conveyor belt in a factory. It moves data from one stage to another, processing it along the way. We used distributed computing techniques to ensure that the pipeline can handle large-scale data efficiently. Each stage of the pipeline has a specific task, like cleaning data, extracting features, and making decisions.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: This is like teaching a dog to fetch. You reward the dog when it brings the ball back and correct it when it doesn't. Our reinforcement learning framework uses similar principles. We designed it to provide feedback to the AI based on its actions, helping it learn and improve over time. We chose algorithms that balance exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (using what it already knows) to ensure the AI learns effectively.

Each component works together to create a system that can learn and adapt, much like a highly intelligent robot.

#### Research Design

Designing our study involved several key steps:

1. **Defining the Research Question**: Our main question was, 'How can we create an AI system that can handle large amounts of data and make smart decisions?' This question guided our entire research process.

2. **Choosing the Right Tools**: We selected tools and algorithms that are known for their efficiency and scalability. For example, we used distributed computing for our data pipeline and advanced preprocessing techniques for MuonClip.

3. **Setting Up Experiments**: We designed experiments to test each component of our system. For MuonClip, we tested its accuracy and speed with different types of data. For the data pipeline, we tested its ability to handle large datasets. For the reinforcement learning framework, we tested how well the AI learns over time.

4. **Collecting and Analyzing Data**: We collected data from various sources to test our system. We analyzed the results to see how well each component performed and made adjustments as needed.

5. **Iterative Improvement**: We used an iterative approach, continually testing and improving each component based on our findings. This helped us create a system that works well together.

Each design choice was important for answering our research question and creating an effective AI system.

#### Methodology

Alright, let's break this down step-by-step. Imagine you're trying to understand how different recipes (architectures) for making a cake (LLM) have changed over time. You have a basic recipe from a few years ago (GPT-2 from 2019) and some new recipes from this year (like DeepSeek V3 and Llama 4). Your goal is to figure out what's changed and why.

First, I gathered all the recipes (architectures) I wanted to compare. I focused on the text capabilities of these models, leaving multimodal stuff for another time. I looked at things like how they handle attention (like MHA, GQA, MLA), how they manage experts (MoE), and other tricks they use to be more efficient.

I started with DeepSeek V3/R1 because it made a big splash in January 2025. I looked at two key ingredients in its recipe: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). I compared these to older methods to see how they improved efficiency and performance.

Then, I moved on to other models like OLMo 2, Gemma 3, and so on. For each, I identified what unique things they were doing. For example, OLMo 2 uses normalization layers in a different way, and Gemma 3 uses sliding window attention.

I broke down each architecture into its basic components and explained how each part contributes to the final dish—a better-performing LLM. I used analogies and simple language to make it easy to understand. For instance, think of MoE as a kitchen with many specialized chefs (experts), but only a few are working on your dish at a time to save resources.

I chose each step because it helped me understand the evolution of these architectures and why certain design choices were made. It's like understanding why a chef adds salt at a specific time—it's all about enhancing the final result.

#### Key Findings

So, what did I find? Well, first, LLMs have come a long way since GPT-2, but the core ideas are still the same. It's like having a basic cake recipe and making small tweaks to improve it.

One big finding is that efficiency is key. Everyone's trying to make their models faster and cheaper to run. Techniques like MLA and MoE are all about doing more with less. For example, DeepSeek V3 uses MLA to save memory and MoE to increase capacity without blowing up the budget.

Another finding is that normalization matters. Where you put your normalization layers (like RMSNorm) can make a big difference in how stable your training is. OLMo 2 and Gemma 3 both play with normalization to improve training.

I also found that sliding window attention is a clever trick to save memory. Gemma 3 uses it to focus on local context, which is cheaper than looking at everything at once.

Overall, these findings show that the devil is in the details. Small changes in architecture can lead to big improvements in performance and efficiency.

#### Technical Approach

Let's dive into the technical stuff. Imagine you're building a complex machine (LLM) and you want to understand how different parts work together to make it run smoothly.

First, let's talk about attention mechanisms. Think of attention as a way for the machine to focus on important parts of the input. Traditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is like having multiple spotlights, each focusing on different parts of the stage. But it's expensive—lots of spotlights mean lots of power (computational resources).

Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) is a way to save power by grouping spotlights together. Instead of each spotlight having its own controls (keys and values), they share controls. This saves power but still lets the machine focus on important parts.

Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is another trick. Instead of sharing controls, it compresses the controls into a smaller space before using them. It's like zipping a file to save space before sending it. This saves memory but adds a step to unzip the file when you need it.

Now, let's talk about Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Think of MoE as a team of specialists. Instead of one big brain trying to do everything, you have a team of smaller brains, each good at different tasks. But you don't use all the brains at once—that would be too expensive. Instead, a router picks a few specialists for each task.

I chose these technical approaches because they're fundamental to understanding how modern LLMs work. Each part—attention mechanisms, expert management—plays a crucial role in making the machine efficient and effective.

I broke down complex algorithms into simple components and used analogies to make them accessible. For example, thinking of MoE as a team of specialists helps understand why it's efficient. Each technical choice was made to optimize the machine's performance while keeping it manageable.

#### Research Design

Designing this study was like planning a big cooking competition. I wanted to compare different recipes (architectures) to see which ones worked best and why.

First, I had to decide which recipes to include. I chose models that were released in 2025 and had a big impact, like DeepSeek V3 and Llama 4. I also included some older models for comparison, like GPT-2.

Next, I had to figure out what aspects of the recipes to compare. I focused on things like attention mechanisms, expert management, and normalization layers. These are the key ingredients that make a big difference in how the final dish (LLM) turns out.

I broke down each recipe into its basic steps and compared them side by side. I used simple language and analogies to explain why each step was important. For example, thinking of attention as spotlights helps understand why GQA and MLA save resources.

I also looked at how these recipes performed in real-world tasks. Benchmarks and leaderboards helped me see which models were doing well and why.

Each design choice was important for answering my research question: how have LLM architectures evolved, and what makes the new ones better? By breaking down each recipe and comparing them step by step, I could see the big picture of how LLMs have improved over time.

#### Methodology

Imagine you're trying to teach a robot to find information in a vast library. The robot needs to understand not just where to look, but also how to ask the right questions to get the information it needs. This is similar to what we're doing with Large Language Models (LLMs) in our research.

Our fundamental problem is figuring out how different ways of organizing and representing knowledge (like how books are arranged in a library) affect how well an LLM can find and use that knowledge. Here's how we approached this step-by-step:

1. **Define the Task**: We wanted the LLM to generate SPARQL queries. SPARQL is a language used to query knowledge graphs, which are like complex maps of information. Think of it as teaching the robot to ask specific questions about the books in the library.

2. **Knowledge Representation**: We organized knowledge in different ways, much like arranging books by author, topic, or publication date. We used various structures and complexities to see how these arrangements affect the LLM's performance.

3. **Agentic RAG Systems**: We created systems where the LLM acts like an agent, actively selecting, interpreting, and querying knowledge sources based on natural language prompts. This is like the robot deciding which section of the library to search based on a question it's asked.

4. **Evaluation**: We systematically evaluated how well the LLM performed with each knowledge representation. This is like testing how quickly and accurately the robot finds the right books under different arrangements.

Each step was necessary to understand how the organization of knowledge impacts the LLM's ability to retrieve and use it effectively.

#### Key Findings

Our main discoveries were that the way knowledge is organized and represented significantly impacts how well an LLM can query a knowledge graph. Here's what we found:

1. **Structure Matters**: The structure of the knowledge graph (like how books are arranged in the library) affects the LLM's ability to generate accurate SPARQL queries. Certain structures make it easier for the LLM to find and use the right information.

2. **Complexity Matters**: The complexity of the knowledge representation (like how detailed the book arrangements are) also impacts performance. Too much complexity can make it harder for the LLM to navigate the knowledge graph effectively.

These findings are significant because they show that the way we organize and represent knowledge can greatly influence the effectiveness of LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation tasks. It's like finding out that the way a library is organized can make a big difference in how quickly and accurately a robot can find the right books.

Our results highlight the importance of designing knowledge representations that are both transferable (can be used in different contexts) and interpretable (easy for the LLM to understand and use).

#### Technical Approach

To understand our technical implementation, let's break it down into simple components:

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Think of LLMs as very smart assistants that can understand and generate human language. They're trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a wide range of tasks.

2. **Knowledge Graphs**: These are like maps of information, where nodes represent entities (like people, places, or things) and edges represent relationships between them. Knowledge graphs are stored in triplestores, which are databases designed to handle this kind of data.

3. **SPARQL Queries**: SPARQL is a language used to query knowledge graphs. It's like a set of instructions you give to the librarian (the triplestore) to find specific information.

4. **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This is a fancy term for a system where the LLM acts like an agent, deciding what information to retrieve and how to use it to generate a response. It's like the robot in the library deciding which books to look at and how to use the information it finds.

Our technical approach involved creating different knowledge representations (like different ways of arranging books) and seeing how well the LLM could generate SPARQL queries (like asking the librarian for specific books) under each representation. We chose this approach because it allows us to directly observe the impact of knowledge organization on the LLM's performance.

To implement this, we used various tools and frameworks that support LLMs, knowledge graphs, and SPARQL queries. Each component works together to create a system where the LLM can actively seek and use information based on natural language prompts.

#### Research Design

To design our study, we thought about how to best answer our research question: How does the conceptualization and representation of knowledge impact an LLM's ability to query a knowledge graph?

Here's our reasoning for the experimental setup:

1. **Knowledge Representations**: We created different knowledge representations to see how each one affected the LLM's performance. This is like setting up different library arrangements to see which one helps the robot find books the fastest.

2. **SPARQL Query Generation**: We chose SPARQL query generation as our task because it's a concrete, measurable way to see how well the LLM can find and use information in the knowledge graph. It's like asking the robot to find specific books and measuring how well it does.

3. **Agentic RAG Systems**: We used agentic RAG systems because they allow the LLM to actively decide what information to retrieve and how to use it. This is like letting the robot decide which books to look at based on the questions it's asked.

4. **Systematic Evaluation**: We evaluated the LLM's performance systematically, using metrics like accuracy and response time. This is like timing the robot and checking if it found the right books under each library arrangement.

Each design choice was important for answering our research question because it allowed us to directly observe the impact of knowledge organization on the LLM's performance in a controlled and measurable way.
