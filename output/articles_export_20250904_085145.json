This makes them poor at *bidirectional* tasks like text embeddings (where understanding context from both directions matters, e.g., search or clustering). Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask (losing pretrained unidirectional strengths), or\n                - Add extra input text (increasing compute cost).\n\n                **Solution**: *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny **BERT-style 'Contextual token'** (pre-encoded from the full input) at the *start* of the LLM’s input. This token acts like a 'cheat sheet'—giving every subsequent token in the LLM a *context-aware* head start, even though the LLM itself still processes text left-to-right.
