The paper proposes **Semantic IDs**: identifiers derived from *embeddings* (vector representations of items) that capture their semantic properties (e.g., a movie’s genre, a product’s features).

This makes them poor at creating *bidirectional* embeddings (vector representations of text where every word understands its full context, like in BERT). Existing fixes either:\n                - Remove the causal mask (breaking the LLM’s pretrained strengths), or\n                - Add extra input text (slowing things down).\n\n                **Solution**: *Causal2Vec* adds a tiny BERT-like module to pre-process the input into a single *Contextual token*, which is fed into the LLM alongside the original text. This lets the LLM 'see' contextualized info *without* breaking its causal structure or adding much overhead. The final embedding combines this Contextual token with the traditional last-token (EOS) output to balance recency bias and semantic depth.\n                \",\n                \"analogy\": \"\n                Imagine reading a book where you can only see one word at a time (like a decoder LLM).
