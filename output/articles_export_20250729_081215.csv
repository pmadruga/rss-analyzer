From Citations to Criticality: Predicting Legal Decision Influence in the Multilingual Swiss Jurisprudence,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13460,2025-07-28T12:05:48+00:00,2025-07-29 08:07:12,"Imagine you're in a busy hospital emergency room. Doctors need to prioritize patients based on the severity of their conditions to ensure the most critical cases are treated first. Similarly, court systems around the world are overwhelmed with cases, and they need a way to prioritize which cases to handle first to optimize time and resources. This is the core problem we're trying to solve.

Our approach can be broken down into several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Just like a doctor needs p...","Our main discoveries were:

1. **Fine-Tuned Models Perform Better**: We found that the smaller, fine-tuned models consistently outperformed the larger language models. This is like discovering that a specialized tool works better than a general-purpose tool for a specific job. The reason is that our fine-tuned models were trained on a large dataset specific to our task, making them experts in predicting legal decision influence.

2. **Large Training Sets Are Valuable**: Our results showed tha...","Think of our technical approach like building a complex machine from simple parts.

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before we can use our data, we need to clean and prepare it. This is like washing and chopping vegetables before cooking. We removed any irrelevant information and structured the data so our models could understand it.

1. **Problem Identification**: We started by identifying the problem of overwhelmed court systems and the need for a triage system to prioritize cases.
