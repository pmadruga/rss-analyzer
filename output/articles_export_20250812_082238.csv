    ""explanation"": ""Imagine you're trying to understand a forest by looking at it from different angles—some close-up (like individual leaves), some far away (like the whole forest). The researchers here are doing something similar but for satellite data. They use a method called 'self-supervised learning,' which is like teaching a computer to recognize patterns without giving it explicit labels. Think of it as solving a puzzle where some pieces are missing, and...",,,

This is how decoder-only language models (LLMs) work—they process text in one direction, which can limit their ability to fully understand the context. Causal2Vec is like giving the model a 'cheat sheet' that summarizes the entire book before it ...",,,
