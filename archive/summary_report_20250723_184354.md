**Key Findings:** Our main discovery was that having a human in the loop significantly improved the LLM's performance on subjective tasks. It's like finding out that having a teacher helps the robot learn better. Here's what we found:

1. **Improved Accuracy**: The LLM's accuracy in labeling sentiments increased after learning from human feedback. This is like the robot getting better grades after studying with a teacher.

2. **Reduced Errors**: The number of mistakes the LLM made decreased over time. This is like the robot making fewer errors on its worksheets.

3. **Better Generalization**: The LLM got better at labeling new, unseen text samples. This is like the robot being able to apply what it learned to new movies it hasn't seen before.

These findings are significant because they show that combining human intelligence with machine learning can help solve complex, subjective tasks more effectively. It's like showing that a student can learn better with a good teacher.
