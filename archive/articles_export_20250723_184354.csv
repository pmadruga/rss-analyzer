That's the fundamental problem we're tackling: how can we help machines understand subjective tasks better? Our approach is like giving the robot a human helper. Here's how we did it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Subjective Task**: First, we needed to pick a task that's subjective, something that humans understand but machines struggl...","Our main discovery was that having a human in the loop significantly improved the LLM's performance on subjective tasks. It's like finding out that having a teacher helps the robot learn better. Here's what we found:

1. **Improved Accuracy**: The LLM's accuracy in labeling sentiments increased after learning from human feedback. This is like the robot getting better grades after studying with a teacher.

2. **Reduced Errors**: The number of mistakes the LLM made decreased over time. This is ...","Think of our technical approach like building a smart assistant that learns from feedback. Here's how we did it:

1. **Large Language Model (LLM)**: We started with a pre-trained LLM, which is like a smart robot that already knows a lot about language. It can understand and generate text, but it's not perfect, especially with subjective tasks.

2. **Annotation Framework**: We built a framework where the LLM could try to label text samples. This is like giving the robot a worksheet to fill out...","To design our study, we thought about how to create an effective learning environment for the LLM. Here's our reasoning:

1. **Choice of Task**: We chose sentiment analysis because it's a common and important subjective task. It's like picking a relevant topic to study in class.

2. **Dataset Selection**: We selected a diverse set of text samples to ensure the LLM learned broadly. This is like choosing a variety of movies to watch and learn from.

3. **Human Feedback Mechanism**: We designed ..."
